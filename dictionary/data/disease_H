Studies have found that taking it at bedtime may allow your body to absorb the medicine better than taking it in the daytime., Wait at least 4 hours after taking thyroid hormone before you\u00a0take fiber supplements, calcium, iron, multivitamins, aluminum hydroxide antacids, colestipol, or medicines that bind bile acids. . While you are taking thyroid replacement therapy, tell your doctor if you have any symptoms\u00a0that suggest your dose is too high,\u00a0such as:Palpitations, Rapid weight loss, Restlessness or shakiness, Sweating. ", "Causes": "The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system. It is located\u00a0at\u00a0the front of the neck, just above where your collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism.Hypothyroidism is more common in women and people over age 50.The most common cause of hypothyroidism is thyroiditis. Swelling and inflammation\u00a0damage the thyroid gland's cells. Causes of this problem include: The immune system\u00a0attacking\u00a0the thyroid gland, Viral infections (common cold) or other respiratory infections, Pregnancy (often called postpartum thyroiditis). Other causes of hypothyroidism include:Certain medicines, such as lithium and amiodarone, Congenital (birth) defects, Radiation treatments to the neck or brain to treat different cancers, Radioactive iodine used to treat an overactive thyroid gland, Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland, Sheehan syndrome, a condition that may occur in a woman who bleeds severely during pregnancy or childbirth and causes the destruction of the pituitary gland, Pituitary tumor or pituitary surgery.

Blood sugar will be low, especially after receiving fructose or sucrose. Uric acid levels will be high.", "Treatment": "Removing fructose and sucrose from the diet is an effective treatment for most patients. Complications are treated. For example, some patients can take medication to lower the level of uric acid in their blood and decrease their risk for gout.", "Causes": "This condition occurs when the body is missing an enzyme called aldolase B. This substance is needed to break down fructose.If a person without this substance eats fructose and sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar), complicated chemical changes occur in the body. The body cannot change its energy storage material, glycogen, into glucose. As a result, the blood sugar falls and dangerous substances build up in the liver.Hereditary fructose intolerance is inherited, which means it is possible to be passed down through families. If both parents carry an abnormal adolase B gene, each of their children has a 25% chance of being affected. The condition may be as common as 1 in 20,000 people in some European countries.", "Prevention": "Couples with a family history of fructose intolerance who wish to have a baby may consider genetic counseling.Most of the damaging effects of the disease can be prevented by sticking to a fructose-free diet."}, "Histoplasmosis": {"description": "Histoplasmosis is an infection that occurs from breathing in the spores of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.", "Possible Complications": "Scarring in the chest cavity may put pressure on the: Major blood vessels carrying blood to and from the heart, Heart, Esophagus (food pipe), Lymph nodes .

To help diagnose this condition, your health care provider may do a:Bronchoscopy, Chest CT scan, Chest x-ray, Spinal tap to look for signs of infection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) . ", "Treatment": "Most of the time, this infection goes away without treatment. If you are sick for more than 1 month or are having trouble breathing, your provider may prescribe medicine. The main treatment for histoplasmosis is antifungal drugs. Antifungals may need to be given through a vein, depending on the form or stage of disease., Some of these medicines can have side effects. . Sometimes, long-term treatment with antifungal drugs may be needed. You may need to take these medicines for up to 1 to 2 years.", "Causes": "Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection. It occurs throughout the world. In the United States, it is most common in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central states.Histoplasma fungus grows as a mold in the soil. You may get sick when you breathe in spores produced by the fungus. Soil that contains bird or bat droppings may have larger amounts of this fungus. The threat is greatest after an old building is torn down, or in caves.This infection can occur in people with a normal immune system, but having a weakened immune system increases the risk of getting or reactivating this disease. Very young or very old people, or those with AIDS, cancer, or an organ transplant have more severe symptoms.People with chronic (long-term) lung disease (such as emphysema and bronchiectasis) are also at higher risk for a more severe infection.", "Prevention": "Histoplasmosis may be prevented by reducing exposure to dust in chicken coops, bat caves, and other high-risk locations.

Special low-protein infant and toddler formulas are available.It is important that a health care provider guide protein intake. The health care provider can balance the amount of protein so that the baby has enough to grow, but not enough to cause symptoms.It is extremely important for people with these disorders to avoid fasting.People with urea cycle abnormalities must also be very careful under times of stress, such as when they have infections. Stress, such as a fever, can cause the body to break down its own proteins. These extra proteins can make it difficult for the abnormal urea cycle to remove the byproducts.Develop a plan with your doctor for when you are sick to avoid all protein, drink high carbohydrate drinks, and get enough fluids.Most patients with urea cycle disorders will need to stay in the hospital at some point. During such times, they may be treated with medicines that help the body remove nitrogen-containing wastes. Dialysis may help rid the body of excess ammonia during extreme illness.", "Causes": "The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder are missing a gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.These diseases include:Argininosuccinic aciduria, Arginase deficiency, Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency, Citrullinemia, N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency (NAGS), Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC). As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of these disorders.Boys are more often affected by ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and develop the disease later in life.To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry the gene until their child gets the disorder.", "Prevention": "As with most inherited diseases, there is no way to prevent these disorders.

Antibodies are proteins the body's immune system makes when it detects harmful substances, such as the HIV virus., Both tests must be positive to confirm an HIV infection. . A complete blood count (CBC) and white blood cell differential may also show abnormalities.People with AIDS usually have regular blood tests to check their CD4 cell count: CD4 cells are a type of T cell. T cells are one kind of immune system cell. They are also called \"helper cells.\", A lower than normal CD4 cell count may be a sign that the virus is damaging the immune system. (A normal CD4 count is from 500 to 1,500 cells/mm3 of blood.), When the CD4 count gets too low, the risk of infections and some types of cancer increase. . Other tests that may be done include:HIV RNA level, or viral load, to check how much HIV is in the blood, Pap smear to check for cervical cancer, Anal pap smear to check for cancer of the anus . ", "Causes": "The virus is spread (transmitted) person-to-person in any of the following ways:Through sexual contact -- including oral, vaginal, and anal sex, Through blood -- by blood transfusions (now extremely rare in the U.S.) or more often by needle sharing, From mother to child -- a pregnant woman can spread the virus to her fetus through their shared blood circulation, or a nursing mother can pass it to her baby through her breast milk . The virus is NOT spread by: Casual contact such as hugging, Mosquitoes, Participating in sports, Touching items that were touched by a person infected with the virus . HIV and blood or organ donation:HIV is not spread to a person who donates blood or organs. People who donate organs are never in direct contact with people who receive them. Likewise, a person who donates blood is never in contact with the person receiving it. In all these procedures, sterile needles and instruments are used., But HIV can be spread to a person receiving blood or organs from an infected donor. To reduce this risk, blood banks and organ donor programs check (screen) donors, blood, and tissues thoroughly. . People at high risk of getting HIV include: Drug users who inject and then share needles, Infants born to mothers with HIV who did not receive HIV treatment during pregnancy, People who have unprotected sex, especially with people who have other high-risk behaviors, are HIV-positive, or have AIDS, People who received blood transfusions or clotting products between 1977 and 1985, before screening for the virus became standard practice, Sexual partners of those who engage in high-risk activities (such as injection drug use or anal sex) . After HIV infects the body, the virus has been found in many different fluids and tissues in the body.Only blood, semen, fluids from the vagina, and breast milk have been shown to transmit infection to others., The virus may also be found in saliva, tears, nervous system tissue, spinal fluid, and blood.. ", "Prevention": "Preventing HIV/AIDS:Do not use illegal drugs and do not share needles or syringes. Many communities now have needle exchange programs, where you can get rid of used syringes and get new, sterile ones. Staff at these programs can also refer you for addiction treatment., Avoid contact with another person's blood. If possible, wear protective clothing, masks, and goggles when caring for people who are injured., If you test positive for HIV, you can pass the virus to others. You should not donate blood, plasma, body organs, or sperm., HIV-positive women who plan to get pregnant should talk to their health care provider about the risk to their unborn child. They should also discuss methods to prevent their baby from becoming infected, such as taking medicines during pregnancy., Breastfeeding should be avoided to prevent passing HIV to infants through breast milk. . Safer sex practices, such as using latex condoms, are effective in preventing the spread of HIV. But there is a risk of getting the infection, even with the use of condoms. Abstinence is the only sure way to prevent sexual transmission of HIV.HIV-positive patients who are taking antiretroviral medicines are less likely to transmit the virus.The U.S. blood supply is among the safest in the world. Nearly all people infected with HIV through blood transfusions received those transfusions before 1985, the year HIV testing began for all donated blood.If you believe you have been exposed to HIV, seek medical attention right away. Do not delay. Starting antiviral medicines can reduce the chance that you will be infected. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). It has been used to prevent transmission in health care workers injured by needle sticks.", "Treatment": "There is no cure for HIV infection at this time. But treatments are available to manage symptoms and reduce how much the virus copies itself (replicates). Treatment can also improve the quality and length of life for those who have already developed symptoms.Antiretroviral therapy suppresses the replication of the HIV virus in the body. A combination of antiretroviral drugs, called antiretroviral therapy (ART) or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), is very effective in reducing the amount of HIV in the bloodstream. This effect is measured by the viral load (how much free virus is found in the blood). Preventing the virus from reproducing (replicating) can improve T-cell counts and help the immune system recover from HIV infection.People on ART with suppressed levels of HIV can still transmit the virus to others through sex or by sharing needles. ART can prolong and improve life if the level of HIV remains suppressed and the CD4 count remains high (above 200 cells/mm3).HIV can become resistant to one combination of ART. This is most true in patients who do not take their medications on schedule every day. Tests can check whether an HIV strain is resistant to a certain drug. This information can help the health care provider find the best drug combination and adjust the drug combination when it starts to fail. When HIV becomes resistant to ART, other drug combinations must be used to try to suppress the resistant strain of HIV. A variety of new drugs on the market treat drug-resistant HIV.ART treatment can have complications. Each drug has its own side effects. Common side effects are:Collection of fat on the back (buffalo hump) and abdomen, Diarrhea, General sick feeling (malaise), Headache, Nausea, Weakness . When used for a long time, these drugs increase the risk of heart attack, perhaps by increasing the levels of cholesterol and glucose (sugar) in the blood.People on ART are monitored by their health care provider for possible side effects. Blood tests measuring CD4 counts and HIV viral load will likely be done every 3 months. The goal is to get the CD4 count close to normal and to suppress the amount of HIV virus in the blood to a level where it cannot be detected.Medicines may be prescribed to treat problems related to AIDS, such as anemia and low white blood cell count, and to prevent opportunistic infections."}, "Hunter syndrome": {"description": "Hunter syndrome is an inherited disease in which long chains of sugar molecules (mucopolysaccharides) are not broken down correctly and build up in the body.", "Possible Complications": "Airway obstruction, Carpal tunnel syndrome, Hearing loss that gets worse over time, Loss of ability to complete daily living activities, Joint stiffness that leads to contractures, Mental function that gets worse over time.

Many tests are used to \u00a0diagnose and monitor heart failure.An echocardiogram (echo) is often the best test for heart failure. Your doctor will use it to guide your treatment.Other imaging tests can look at how well your heart is able to pump blood, and how much the heart muscle is damaged.Many blood tests may also be used to:Help diagnose and monitor heart failure, Identify risks for heart disease, Look for possible causes of heart failure, or problems that may make your heart failure worse, Monitor for side effects of medicines you may be taking . ", "Causes": "Heart failure is often a long-term (chronic) condition, but it may come on suddenly. It can be caused by many different heart problems.The condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. More often, both sides of the heart are involved. Heart failure is present when:Your heart muscle cannot pump (eject) the blood out of the heart very well. This is called systolic heart failure., Your heart muscles are stiff and do not fill up with blood easily. This is called diastolic heart failure. . As the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid may build up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure.The most common causes of heart failure are:Coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. This can weaken the heart muscle over time or suddenly., High blood pressure that is not well controlled, leading to problems with stiffness, or eventually leading to muscle weakening. . Other heart problems that may cause heart failure are:Congenital heart disease, Heart attack, Heart valves that are leaky or narrowed), Infection that weakens the heart muscle, Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) . Other diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:Amyloidosis, Emphysema, Overactive thyroid, Sarcoidosis, Severe anemia, Too much iron in the body, Underactive thyroid .

You will have follow-up appointments at least every 3 to 6 months, but sometimes much more often. You will also have tests to check your heart function.Knowing your body and the symptoms that your heart failure is getting worse will help you stay healthier and out of the hospital. At home, watch for changes in your heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, and weight.Weight gain, especially over a day or two, can be a sign that your body is holding onto extra fluid and your heart failure is getting worse. Talk to your doctor about what you should do if your weight goes up or you develop more symptoms.Limit how much salt you eat. Your doctor may also ask you to limit how much fluid you drink during the day.Other important changes to make in your lifestyle:Ask your doctor how much alcohol you may drink.\r\n , Do not smoke.\r\n , Stay active. Walk or ride a stationary bicycle. Your doctor can provide a safe and effective exercise plan for you. Do not exercise on days when your weight has gone up from fluid or you are not feeling well.\r\n , Lose weight if you are overweight.\r\n , Lower your cholesterol by changing your lifestyle.\r\n , Get enough rest, including after exercise, eating, or other activities. This allows your heart to rest too.\r\n . MEDICATIONS, SURGERY, AND DEVICES\r\nYour doctor will ask you to take medicines to treat your heart failure. Medicines treat the symptoms, prevent your heart failure from getting worse, and help you live longer. It is very important that you take your medicine as your health care team directed.These medicines:Help the heart muscle pump better\r\n , Keep your blood from clotting\r\n , Lower your cholesterol levels\r\n , Open up blood vessels or slow your heart rate so your heart doesn't have to work as hard\r\n , Reduce damage to the heart\r\n , Reduce the risk of abnormal heart rhythms\r\n , Replace potassium\r\n , Rid your body of excess fluid and salt (sodium)\r\n . It is very important that you take your medicine as your doctor and nurse directed. Do not take any other drugs or herbs without first asking your doctor or nurse about them. Drugs that may make your heart failure worse include:Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)\r\n , Naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)\r\n . The following surgeries and devices for certain patients with heart failure may be recommended:Coronary bypass surgery (CABG) or angioplasty with or without stenting may help improve blood flow to the damaged or weakened heart muscle.\r\n , Heart valve surgery may be done if changes in a heart valve are causing your heart failure.\r\n , A pacemaker can help treat slow heart rates or help both sides of your heart contract at the same time.\r\n , A defibrillator sends an electrical pulse to stop life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms.\r\n . END-STAGE HEART FAILURESevere heart failure occurs when treatments no longer work. Certain treatments may be used when a person is waiting for a heart transplant:Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)\r\n , Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\n . At a certain point, the health care provider will decide whether it is best to keep treating heart failure aggressively. The patient, along with his or her family and doctors, may want to discuss palliative or comfort care at this time.\r\n"}, "How to care for pressure sores": {"Symptoms": ["Stage I: A reddened, painful area on the skin that does not turn white when pressed.

They produce parathyroid hormone. This hormone controls calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone.When calcium levels are too low, the body responds by making more parathyroid hormone. This hormone causes calcium levels in the blood to rise, as more calcium is taken from the bone and reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney. One or more of the parathyroid glands may grow larger.

Also, the pulse at various locations (wrist, groin, and others) may be very weak. There are usually (but not always) abnormal heart sounds when listening to the chest.Tests may include:Cardiac catheterization, ECG, Echocardiogram, X-ray of the chest. ", "Treatment": "Once the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart is made, the baby will be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. A breathing machine (ventilator) may be needed to help the baby breathe. A medicine called prostaglandin E1 is used to keep blood circulating to the body by keeping the ductus arteriosus open.These measures do not solve the problem. The condition always requires surgery.The first surgery, called the Norwood operation, occurs within the baby's first few days of life. The Norwood procedure consists of building a new aorta by:Using the pulmonary valve and artery, Connecting the hypoplastic old aorta and coronary arteries to the new aorta, Removing the wall between the atria (atrial septum), Making an artificial connection from either the right ventricle or a body-wide artery to the pulmonary artery to maintain blood flow to the lungs (called a shunt). Afterward, the baby usually goes home. The child will need to take daily medicines and be closely followed by a pediatric cardiologist, who will determine when the second stage of surgery should be done.Stage II of the operation is called the Glenn shunt or hemi-Fontan procedure. This procedure connects the major vein carrying blue blood from the top half of the body (the superior vena cava) directly to blood vessels to the lungs (pulmonary arteries) to get oxygen. The surgery is usually done when the child is 4 to 6 months of age.During stages I and II, the child may still appear somewhat blue (cyanotic).Stage III, the final step, is called the Fontan procedure. The rest of the veins that carry blue blood from the body (the inferior vena cava) are connected directly to the blood vessels to the lungs. The right ventricle now serves only as the pumping chamber for the body (no longer the lungs and the body). This surgery is usually performed when the baby is 18 months\u00a0to\u00a04 years old. After this final step, the\u00a0child is no longer\u00a0cyanotic and has a normal oxygen level in the blood.Some patients may need more surgeries in their 20s or 30s if they develop hard to control arrhythmias or other complications of the Fontan procedure.Some doctors consider heart transplantation\u00a0an alternative to\u00a0the three-step surgery.\u00a0But there are few donated hearts available for small infants.", "Causes": "Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females.As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause.\u00a0About 10% of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:Aorta -- the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body, Entrance and exit of the ventricle, Mitral and aortic valves. This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be\u00a0poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.In patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and the left side of the heart, or between the arteries and pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two of these connections:Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium), Ductus arteriosus (a small blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery). Both of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood\u00a0leaving the right side of the heart through the pulmonary artery travels through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the\u00a0baby may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body. Babies with known hypoplastic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open.Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).", "Prevention": "There is no known prevention for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

", "Possible Complications": "Brain herniation, Brain swelling, Increased risk of heart, kidney, and breathing problems, Increased risk of body-wide infection, Permanent nervous system damage, Coma that continues to get worse, Side effects of medicines. ", "Symptoms": ["Breath with a musty or sweet odor", "Change in sleep patterns", "Changes in thinking", "Confusion that is mild", "Forgetfulness", "Mental fogginess", "Personality or mood changes", "Poor concentration", "Poor judgment", "Worsening of handwriting or loss of other small hand movements ", "Abnormal movements or shaking of hands or arms", "Agitation, excitement, or seizures (occur rarely)", "Disorientation", "Drowsiness or confusion", "Strange\u00a0behavior or severe personality changes", "Slurred speech", "Slowed or sluggish movement "], "Exams and Tests": "Signs of nervous system changes may include:Shaking of the hands (\"flapping\") when trying to hold arms in front of the body and lift the hands, Problems with thinking and doing mental tasks, Signs of liver disease, such as yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) and fluid collection in the abdomen (ascites), Musty odor to the breath and urine. Tests may include:Complete blood count or hematocrit to check for anemia, CT scan of the head or MRI, EEG, Liver function tests, Prothrombin time, Serum ammonia levels, Sodium level in the blood, Potassium level in the blood, BUN and creatinine to see how the kidneys are working . ", "Treatment": "Hepatic encephalopathy can be a medical emergency that requires a hospital stay.The first step is to identify and treat any factors that may have caused hepatic encephalopathy.Gastrointestinal bleeding must be stopped. The intestines must be emptied of blood. Infections, kidney failure, and electrolyte abnormalities (especially potassium) need to be treated.Life support may be necessary to help with breathing or blood circulation, particularly if the person is in a coma. The brain may swell, which can be life-threatening.If the problem is very bad, you may need to cut down the protein in your diet. However, too little protein can cause malnutrition, so you should talk to a dietitian about how to change your diet. People who are very ill may need intravenous or tube feedings.You may be given lactulose to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia and to remove blood from the intestines. You may also get neomycin to reduce ammonia production by intestinal bacteria. Rifaximin, a new antibiotic, is also effective in hepatic encephalopathy.You may need to avoid sedatives, tranquilizers, and any other medicines that are broken down by the liver. Medicines containing ammonium (including certain antacids) should also be avoided. Your doctor may suggest other medicines and treatments. These may have varying results.", "Causes": "The exact cause of hepatic encephalopathy is unknown. Hepatic encephalopathy is brought on by disorders that affect the liver. These include:Conditions that reduce liver function (such as cirrhosis or hepatitis), Conditions in which blood circulation does not enter the liver . An important job of the liver is to make toxic substances in the body harmless. These can include substances made by the body as well things that you take in (such as medicines). However, when the liver is damaged, these \"poisons\" can build up in the bloodstream. Ammonia, which is produced by the body when proteins are digested, is one of the substances normally made harmless by the liver. Other toxins may also build up. These things can cause damage to the nervous system.When liver damage occurs, hepatic encephalopathy may occur suddenly, even in people who have not had liver problems in the past. More often, the problem develops in people with chronic liver disease.Hepatic encephalopathy may be triggered by:Dehydration, Eating too much protein, Electrolyte abnormalities (especially a decrease in potassium) from vomiting, or from treatments such as paracentesis or taking diuretics (\"water pills\"), Bleeding from the intestines, stomach, or esophagus, Infections, Kidney problems, Low oxygen levels in the body, Shunt placement or complications, Surgery, Medicines that suppress the central nervous system (such as barbiturates or benzodiazepine tranquilizers). Disorders that can appear similar to hepatic encephalopathy include:Alcohol intoxication, Complicated alcohol withdrawal, Meningitis, Metabolic abnormalities such as low blood glucose, Sedative overdose, Subdural hematoma (bleeding under the skull), Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In some cases, hepatic encephalopathy is a short-term problem that can be corrected. It may also occur as part of a chronic problem from liver disease that gets worse over time. ", "Prevention": "Treating liver problems may prevent hepatic encephalopathy. Avoiding heavy drinking and intravenous drug use can prevent many liver disorders."}}
