Keep the skin moist (called lubricating or moisturizing the skin). Use ointments (such as petroleum jelly), creams, or lotions 2 - 3 times a day. Choose skin products that are\u00a0free of alcohol, scents, dyes,\u00a0and other chemicals. A humidifier to keep home air moist\u00a0will also help.Avoid\u00a0things that make\u00a0your symptoms worse, such as:Foods\u00a0that may cause an allergic reaction such as eggs in a very young child (always talk to your doctor first), Irritants such as wool and lanolin, Strong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solvents, Sudden changes in body temperature and stress, which may cause sweating , Triggers that cause allergy symptoms. When washing or bathing:Expose your skin to water for as short a time as possible. Short, cooler baths are better then long, hot baths. , Use gentle body washes and cleansers instead of regular soaps. , Do not scrub or dry the skin too hard or for too long., Apply lubricating creams, lotions, or ointment\u00a0to the skin after bathing while it is damp. This will help trap moisture in the skin.. MEDICATIONSAt this time, allergy shots are not used to treat atopic dermatitis.\u00a0\u00a0Antihistamines taken by mouth may help with itching or\u00a0allergies. You can often buy these medicines without a prescription.

You may need a stronger medicine if this doesn't work.\u00a0, Medicines called topical immunomodulators (TIMs) may be prescribed for anyone over 2 years old. TIMs include tacrolimus (protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Ask your doctor about concerns over a possible cancer risk with the use of these medicines., Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin may be used for thickened areas., Barrier repair creams containing ceramides may be used.. Wet-wrap treatment with topical corticosteroids may help control the condition but may lead to an infection. Other\u00a0treatments that may be used include:Antibiotic creams or pills if the skin is infected, Drugs that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil, Phototherapy, a medical treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, Short-term use of systemic steroids. ", "Causes": "Atopic\u00a0dermatitis is due to a skin\u00a0reaction (similar to an allergy) in the skin. The reaction leads to ongoing swelling and redness. People with atopic dermititis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks certain proteins.Atopic dermatitis\u00a0is most common in infants. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood. People with\u00a0atopic dermatitis\u00a0often have asthma or seasonal allergies.\u00a0There is often a family history of allergies\u00a0such as asthma, hay fever, or eczema. People with atopic dermatitis often\u00a0test positive to\u00a0allergy skin tests.However, atopic dermatitis is not caused by allergies. The following can make\u00a0atopic dermatitis\u00a0symptoms worse:Allergies to pollen, mold, dust mites, or animals, Cold and dry air in the winter, Colds or the flu, Contact with irritants and chemicals, Contact with rough materials, such as wool, Dry skin, Emotional stress , Drying out of the skin from\u00a0taking too many\u00a0baths or showers and swimming too often, Getting too hot or too cold, as well as sudden changes of temperature, Perfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps.

The knee may be tender and mildly swollen. Also, the kneecap may not be perfectly lined up with the thigh bone (femur).When you flex your knee, you may feel a grinding feeling below the kneecap. Pressing the kneecap when the knee is straightening out may be painful.Your provider may want you to do a single leg squat to look at muscle imbalance and your core stabilityX-rays are very often normal. However, a special x-ray view of the kneecap may show signs of arthritis or tilting.MRI scans are rarely needed.", "Treatment": "Resting the knee for a short period of time and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin may help relieve pain. Other things you can do to relieve anterior knee pain include:Change the way you exercise, Learn exercises to both strengthen and stretch the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, Learn exercises to strengthen your core, Lose weight (if you are overweight), Use special shoe inserts and support devices (orthotics) if you have flat feet, Tape your knee to realign the kneecap, Wear the correct running or sports shoes. Rarely, surgery for pain behind the kneecap is needed. During the surgery: Kneecap cartilage that has been damaged may be removed , Changes may be made to the tendons to help the kneecap move more evenly. ", "Causes": "Your kneecap (patella) sits over the front of your knee joint. As you bend or straighten your knee, the underside of the patella glides over the bones that make up the knee.Strong tendons help attach the kneecap to the bones and muscles that surround the knee. These tendons are called:The patellar tendon (where the kneecap attaches to the shin bone), The quadriceps tendon (where the thigh muscles attach to the top of the kneecap) . Anterior knee pain begins when the kneecap does not move properly and rubs against the lower part of the thigh bone. This may occur because:The kneecap is in an abnormal position (also called poor alignment of the patellofemoral joint)., There is tightness or weakness of the muscles on the front and back of your thigh., You are doing too much activity that places extra stress on the kneecap (such as running, jumping or twisting, skiing, or playing soccer)., You have flat feet. . Anterior knee pain is more common in:People who are overweight, People who have had a dislocation, fracture, or other injury to the kneecap, Runners, jumpers, skiers, bicyclists, and soccer players who exercise often, Teenagers and healthy young adults, more often girls . Other possible causes of anterior knee pain include:Arthritis, Pinching of the inner lining of the knee during movement (called synovial impingement or plica syndrome) .

Endoscopy (a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube that has a small camera on the end) may help diagnose adhesions:Hysteroscopy looks inside the uterus, Laparoscopy looks inside the abdomen and pelvis. ", "Treatment": "Surgery may be done to separate the adhesions. This can let the organ regain normal movement and reduce symptoms. However, the risk for more adhesions goes up with more surgeries.Depending on the location of the adhesions, a barrier may be placed at the time of surgery to help reduce the chance of the adhesions returning.", "Causes": "As the body moves, tissues or organs inside are normally able to shift around each other. This is because these tissues have slippery surfaces. Inflammation (swelling), surgery, or injury can cause adhesions to form and prevent this movement. Adhesions can occur almost anywhere in the body, including:Joints, such as the shoulder, Eyes, Inside the abdomen or pelvis. Adhesions can become larger or tighter over time. Problems may occur if the adhesions cause an organ or body part to:Twist, Pull out of position, Be unable to move normally. The risk of forming adhesions is high after bowel or female organ surgeries. Surgery using a laparoscope is less likely to cause adhesions than open surgery.Other causes of adhesions in the abdomen or pelvis include:Appendicitis, most often when the appendix breaks open (ruptures), Cancer, Endometriosis, Infections in the abdomen and pelvis, Radiation treatment.

If fluid is putting pressure on the lung, removing the fluid may allow the lung to expand.Treatments for atelectasis include one or more of the following:Clap (percussion) on the chest to loosen mucus plugs in the airway, Perform deep breathing exercises (with the help of incentive spirometry devices), Remove or relieve any blockage in the airways by bronchoscopy., Tilt the person so the head is lower than the chest (called postural drainage). This allows mucus to drain more easily., Treat a tumor or other condition, if there is one, Turn the person to lie on the healthy side, allowing the collapsed area of lung to re-expand, Use aerosolized respiratory treatments (inhaled medications) to open the airway, Use other devices that help increase positive pressure in the airways and clear fluids (positive expiratory pressure [PEP] devices) . ", "Causes": "Atelectasis is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung.Another type of collapsed lung is called pneumothorax. It occurs when air escapes from the lung. The air then fills the space outside of the lung, between the lung and chest wall.Atelectasis\u00a0is common after surgery or in patients who were in the hospital.Risk factors for developing atelectasis include:Anesthesia, Foreign object in the airway (most common in children), Lung diseases, Mucus that plugs the airway, Pressure on the lung caused by a buildup of fluid between the ribs and the lungs (called a pleural effusion), Prolonged bed rest with few changes in position, Shallow breathing (may be caused by painful breathing), Tumors that block an airway .

Further testing may be needed if the doctor or parents are concerned. This is particularly true if a child fails to meet any of the following language milestones:Babbling by 12 months, Gesturing (pointing, waving bye-bye) by 12 months, Saying single words by 16 months, Saying two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months (not just echoing), Losing any language or social skills at any age . These children might receive a hearing evaluation, blood lead test, and screening test for ASD.A health care provider experienced in diagnosing and treating\u00a0ASD is usually needed to make the actual diagnosis. Because there is no biological test, such as a blood test, for ASD,\u00a0the diagnosis will often be based on guidelines from a medical book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).An evaluation of\u00a0ASD will often include a complete physical and nervous system (neurologic) examination. Tests may be done to see if there is a problem with genes or the body's metabolism.ASD\u00a0includes a broad spectrum of symptoms. Therefore, a single, brief evaluation cannot predict a child's true abilities. It is best to have a team of specialists evaluate the child. They might evaluate:Communication, Language, Motor skills, Speech, Success at school, Thinking abilities . Some parents do not want to have their child diagnosed because they are afraid the child will be labeled. But without a diagnosis, the child may not get the necessary treatment and services.", "Treatment": "At this time, there is no cure for ASD. An early, intensive, appropriate treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children with ASD. Most programs build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities. The best treatment plan may use a combination of techniques, including:Applied behavior analysis (ABA), Medications, Occupational therapy, Physical therapy, Speech-language therapy . APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA)This program is for younger children. It can be effective in some cases. ABA uses one-on-one teaching that reinforces the practice of various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal developmental functioning.ABA programs are usually done in a child's home under the supervision of a behavioral psychologist. These programs can be very expensive and have not been widely adopted by school systems. Parents often must seek funding and staffing from other sources, which can be hard to find in many communities.TEACCHAnother program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). TEACCH was developed as a statewide program in North Carolina. It uses picture schedules and other visual cues that help the child work independently and organize and structure their environments.Though TEACCH tries to improve a child's adaptation and skills, it also accepts the problems associated with ASD. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH programs do not expect children to achieve typical development with treatment.MEDICINEThere is no medicine that treats ASD itself. But medicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with\u00a0ASD may have, including:Aggression, Anxiety, Attention problems, Extreme compulsions that the child cannot stop, Hyperactivity, Impulsiveness, Irritability, Mood swings, Outbursts, Sleep difficulty, Tantrums . Currently, only risperidone is approved to treat children ages 5\u00a0through 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with ASD. Other medicines that may also be used include mood stabilizers and stimulants.DIETSome children with\u00a0ASD appear to respond to a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is found in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is found in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that dietary changes will make a difference, and not all studies of this method have shown positive results.If you are considering these or other dietary changes, talk to both a doctor who specializes in the digestive system (gastroenterologist) and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure that the child is still receiving enough calories, nutrients, and a balanced diet.OTHER APPROACHESBeware that there are widely publicized treatments for\u00a0ASD that do not have scientific support, and reports of miracle cures that do not live up to expectations. If your child has ASD, it may be helpful to talk with other parents of children with\u00a0ASD and\u00a0ASD specialists. Follow the progress of research in this area, which is rapidly developing.", "Causes": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a\u00a0physical condition linked to abnormal biology and chemistry in the brain. The exact causes of these abnormalities are not known. There is likely a combination of factors that lead to ASD. It may run in some families, and research shows that a number of genes may be involved. Many other possible causes have been suspected, but not proven. Some researchers believe that damage to a specific part of the brain, called the amygdala, may be involved. Other researchers are looking at whether a virus may trigger symptoms.Some parents have heard that vaccines children receive may cause ASD. Several research studies have found no connection between vaccines and ASD. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that there is no link between ASD and vaccines.Some doctors think the increase in the number of children with ASD is due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD.

During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. Less air is able to pass through as a result.Asthma is often seen in children. It is a leading cause of missed school days and hospital visits for children. An allergic reaction is a key part of asthma in children. Asthma and allergies often occur together.Some things that can bring on asthma symptoms (triggers) include:Animals (hair or dander), Dust, mold, and pollen, Aspirin and other medicines, Changes in weather (most often cold weather), Chemicals in the air or in food, Tobacco smoke, Exercise, Strong emotions, Viral infections, such as the common cold . ", "Treatment": "You and your child's doctors should work together as a team to create and carry out an asthma action plan. This plan will tell you how to:Avoid asthma triggers, Monitor symptoms, Measure peak flow, Take medicines . The plan should also tell you when to call the nurse or doctor. It is important to know what questions to ask your child's doctor.Children with asthma need a lot of support at school.Give the school staff your asthma action plan so they know how to take care of your child's asthma., Find out how to let your child take medicine during school hours. (You may need to sign a consent form.), Having asthma does not mean your child cannot exercise. Coaches, gym teachers, and your child should know what to do if your child has asthma symptoms caused by exercise. . ASTHMA MEDICINESThere are two basic kinds of medicine used to treat asthma. Long-term control drugs are taken every day to prevent asthma symptoms. Your child should take these medicines even if no symptoms are present. Some children may need more than one long-term control medicine.Types of long-term control medicines include:Inhaled steroids (these are usually the first choice of treatment), Long-acting bronchodilators (these are almost always used with inhaled steroids), Leukotriene inhibitors, Cromolyn sodium . Quick relief or rescue asthma drugs work fast to control asthma symptoms. Children take them when they are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack.Some of your child's asthma medicines can be taken using an inhaler.Children who use an inhaler should use a spacer device. This helps them get the medicine into the lungs properly., If your child uses the inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets into the lungs. Have your health care provider show your child how to correctly use an inhaler., Younger children can use a nebulizer instead of an inhaler to take their medicine. A nebulizer turns asthma medicine into a mist. . GETTING RID OF TRIGGERSIt is important to know what things make your child's asthma worse. These are called asthma triggers. Avoiding them is the first step toward helping your child feeling better.Keep pets outdoors, or at least away from the child's bedroom.No one should smoke in a house or around a child with asthma. Getting rid of tobacco smoke in the home is the single most important thing a family can do to help a child with asthma., Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke carry the smoke inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms., Do not use indoor fireplaces. . Keep the house clean. Keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches, which can trigger asthma attacks. Cleaning products in the home should be unscented.MONITOR YOUR CHILD'S ASTHMAChecking peak flow is one of the best ways to control asthma. It can help you keep your child's asthma from getting worse. Asthma attacks do NOT usually come on without warning.Children under age 5 may not be able to use a peak flow meter well enough for it to be helpful. However, a child should start using the peak flow meter at a young age to get used to it. An adult should always watch for a child's asthma symptoms."}, "Anorectal abscess": {"description": "An anorectal abscess is a collection of pus in the area of the anus and rectum.", "Possible Complications": "Anal fistula (abnormal collection between the anus and another structure), Infection that spreads to the blood (sepsis), Continuing pain, Problem keeps coming back (recurrence), Scars .

", "Causes": "An embolus is a blood clot or a piece of plaque that acts like a clot. Emboli means there is more than one clot or piece of plaque. When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism.An arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots. The clots can get stuck in an artery and block blood flow. The blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death (necrosis).Arterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Emboli that occur in the brain cause a stroke. Ones that occur in the heart cause a heart attack. Less common sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes.Risk factors for arterial embolism include:A type of abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, Injury or damage to an artery wall, Conditions that increase blood clotting (such as a very high platelet count) . Another condition that poses a high risk for embolization (especially to the brain) is mitral stenosis. Endocarditis (infection of the inside of the heart) can also cause arterial emboli.A common source for an embolus is from areas of hardening (atherosclerosis) in the aorta and other large blood vessels. These clots can break loose and flow down to the legs and feet.Paradoxical embolization can take place when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side. The clot can then move to an artery and block blood flow to the brain (stroke) or other organs.If a clot involves the arteries supplying blood flow to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus.", "Prevention": "Prevention begins with finding the source of the blood clot. Your health care provider may prescribe blood thinners (such as warfarin or heparin) to prevent clots from forming. Antiplatelet drugs may also be needed.You have a higher risk atherosclerosis and clots if you are:A smoker, Inactive and do little exercise, Overweight, Stressed .

Treatments that may help include:Wearing compression stockings, Eating extra salt, Sleeping with the head elevated, Using medicines. Bladder\u00a0problems may be treated with:Manual expression of urine, Intermittent catheterization (male or female), Medicines. Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary.

Small tumors with few or no symptoms may be watched for changes, especially\u00a0in older patients. Regular MRI scans will be done.If they are not treated, some acoustic neuromas can damage the nerves involved in hearing and balance. They can also affect the nerves responsible for movement and feeling in the face. Very large tumors can lead to a buildup of fluid (hydrocephalus) in the brain, which can be life threatening.Removing an acoustic neuroma is more commonly done for:Larger tumors, Tumors that are causing symptoms, Tumors that are growing quickly, Tumors that are pressing on the brain . Surgery is done to remove the tumor and prevent other nerve damage. Any hearing that is left is often lost with surgery.Stereotactic radiosurgery focuses high-powered x-rays on a small area.

Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is related to poor personal hygiene and poor sanitation. People who live in places where human feces (stool) are used as fertilizer are also at risk for this disease.Once consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae inside the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae move through the bloodstream to the lungs. They travel up through the large airways of the lungs, and are swallowed back into the stomach and small intestine.As the larvae move through the lungs they may cause an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. Once the larvae are back in the small intestine, they mature into adult roundworms.

People most at risk for cutaneous anthrax include farm workers, veterinarians, and tannery and wool workers.. Inhalation anthrax develops when anthrax spores enter the lungs through the respiratory tract. It is most commonly contracted when workers breathe in airborne anthrax spores during processes such as tanning hides and processing wool.Breathing in spores means a person has been exposed to anthrax, but it does not mean the person will have symptoms.The bacteria spores must germinate or sprout (the same way a seed might sprout before a plant grows) before the actual disease occurs.

In the most severe cases, surgery is needed to remove damaged, dead or infected pancreatic tissue.Avoid smoking, alcoholic drinks, and fatty foods after the attack has improved.", "Causes": "The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach that produces chemicals called enzymes, which are needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. Most of the time, the enzymes are only active after they reach the small intestine. When these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding (hemorrhage), and damage to the organ and its blood vessels. This condition is called acute pancreatitis.Acute pancreatitis affects men more often than women. Certain diseases, surgeries, and habits make you more likely to develop this condition. The two most common causes of pancreatitis in the United States are heavy alcohol use and gallstones. Alcohol use is responsible for up to 70% of cases in the United States. Acute pancreatitis typically requires 5 to 8 drinks per day for 5 or more years. Gallstones are the next most common cause. The condition develops when the gallstones travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, where they block the opening that drains the common bile duct and pancreatic duct (ampulla). Genetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known.Other conditions that have been linked to pancreatitis are:Autoimmune problems (when the immune system attacks the body), Damage to the ducts or pancreas during surgery, High blood levels of a fat called triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia) usually above 1000 mg/dL, Injury to the pancreas from an accident . Other causes include:Complications of cystic fibrosis, Hemolytic uremic syndrome, Hyperparathyroidism, Kawasaki disease, Reye syndrome, Use of certain medications (especially estrogens, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, thiazides and azathioprine), Viral infections, including mumps, coxsackie B, mycoplasma pneumonia, and campylobacter, Injury to the pancreas after a procedure such as an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) or EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) with FNA (fine needle aspirate). ", "Prevention": "You may lower your risk of new or repeat episodes of pancreatitis by taking steps to prevent the medical conditions that can lead to the disease:Avoid aspirin when treating a fever in children, especially if they may have a viral illness, to reduce the risk of Reye syndrome., Do NOT drink too much alcohol., Make sure children receive vaccines to protect them against mumps and other childhood illnesses., Treat medical conditions that contribute to hypertriglyceridemia. .

Testing is not needed in most cases.", "description": "Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples or \"zits.\" Whiteheads, blackheads, and red, inflamed patches of skin (such as cysts) may develop.", "Causes": "Acne occurs when tiny holes on the surface of the skin become clogged. These holes are called pores. Each pore opens to a follicle. A follicle contains a hair and an oil gland. The oil released by the gland helps remove old skin cells and keeps your skin soft., When glands produce too much oil, the pores can become blocked. Dirt, bacteria, and cells build up. The blockage is called a plug or comedone., If the top of the plug is white, it is called a\u00a0whitehead., If the top of the plug is\u00a0dark, it is called a blackhead., If the plug breaks open, swelling and red bumps occur., Acne that is deep in your skin can\u00a0cause hard, painful cysts. This is called cystic acne.. Acne is most common in teenagers, but anyone can get acne, even babies. The problem tends to run in families.Some things that may trigger acne include: Hormonal changes that make the skin oilier. These may be related to puberty, menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills, or stress. , Greasy or oily cosmetic and hair products, Certain drugs (such as steroids, testosterone, estrogen, and phenytoin), Heavy sweating and humidity. Research does not show that chocolate, nuts, and greasy foods cause acne. However, diets high in refined sugars or dairy products may be related to acne in some people.", "Treatment": "SELF-CARESteps you can take to help your acne:Clean your skin gently with a mild, nondrying soap (such as Dove, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, CeraVe, or Basics)., Look for water-based or \"noncomedogenic\" formulas for cosmetics and skin creams. (Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne.), Remove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising., Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing., Shampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily., Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face. . What NOT to do:Try not to squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples. This can lead to skin infections and scarring., Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats., Avoid touching your face with your hands or fingers., Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams., Do not leave make-up on overnight. . If these steps do not clear up the blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid., They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel., They may cause redness or peeling of the skin. . A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly, but tanning mostly hides the acne. Too much exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet rays is not recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer.MEDICINES FROM YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERIf pimples are still a problem, a health care provider can prescribe stronger medications and discuss other options with you.Antibiotics may help some people with acne:Oral antibiotics (taken by mouth) such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin, Topical antibiotics (applied to the skin) such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or dapsone . Creams or gels applied to the skin may be prescribed:Retinoic acid cream or gel (tretinoin, Retin-A), Prescription formulas of benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid, Topical azelaic acid . For women whose acne is caused or made worse by hormones:A pill called spironolactone may help, Birth control pills may help in some cases, though they may make acne worse in some women.. Minor procedures or treatments may also be helpful:A laser procedure called photodynamic therapy may be used., Your doctor may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone.. People who have cystic acne and scarring may try a medicine called isotretinoin (Accutane). You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects.Pregnant women should NOT take Accutane, because it causes severe birth defects. Women taking Accutane must use two forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program., Your doctor will follow you on this drug and you will have regular blood tests. .

The blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen. The eyes can become red, itchy, and teary very quickly.The pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny, hard-to-see pollens that may cause hay fever include grasses, ragweed and trees.Your symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground.Allergies tend to run in families.

Your doctor will discuss with you:The risk that your AVM will break open (rupture). If this happens, there may be permanent brain damage., The risk of any brain damage if you have one of the surgical treatments listed below.. Your doctor may discuss different factors that may increase your risk of bleeding, including:Current or planned pregnancies, What the AVM looks like on imaging tests, Size of the AVM, Your age, Your symptoms. A bleeding AVM is a medical emergency. The goal of treatment is to prevent further complications by controlling bleeding and seizures and, if possible, removing the AVM.Three surgical treatments are available. Some treatments are used together.Open brain surgery -- removes the abnormal connection through an opening made in the skull. It must be done by a highly skilled surgeon.Embolization (endovascular treatment): A catheter is guided through a small cut in your groin to an artery and then to the small blood vessels in your brain where the aneurysm is located., A glue-like substance is injected into the abnormal vessels to stop blood flow in the AVM and reduce the risk of bleeding. This may be the first choice for some kinds of AVMs, or if surgery cannot be done.. Stereotactic radiosurgery is another alternative.This procedure delivers very focused radiation directly to the area of the AVM to cause scarring and shrinkage., It is particularly useful for small AVMs deep in the brain, which are difficult to remove by surgery.. Anticonvulsant medications, such as phenytoin, are usually prescribed if seizures occur.", "Causes": "The cause of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is unknown. The condition occurs when arteries in the brain connect directly to nearby veins without having the normal vessels (capillaries) between them.Arteriovenous malformations vary in size and location in the brain.An AVM rupture occurs because of pressure and damage to blood vessel tissue. This allows blood to leak into the brain or surrounding tissues, and reduces blood flow to the brain.Cerebral AVMs occur in less than 1% of people. Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Hemorrhages occur most often in people ages 15 - 20, but can also occur later in life.

To ease symptoms, drainage, chest percussion, and vibration can help remove fluids from the lungs.The doctor may prescribe aerosol medications to thin lung fluids. People with this condition may need to receive oxygen by mask or by a plastic piece that fits into the nostrils. Certain patients may need a lung transplant.", "Causes": "Breathing in asbestos fibers can cause scar tissue (fibrosis) to form inside the lung. Scarred lung tissue does not expand and contract normally.How severe the disease is depends on how long the person was exposed to asbestos and the amount he or she breathed in. Often, people do not notice symptoms for 20 years or more after the asbestos exposure.Asbestos fibers were commonly used in construction before 1975. Asbestos exposure occurred in asbestos mining and milling, construction, fireproofing, and other industries. Families of asbestos workers can also be exposed from particles brought home on the worker's clothing.Other asbestos-related diseases include:Pleural plaques (calcification), Malignant mesothelioma\u00a0(cancer of the pleura, the lining of the lung), which can develop 20 to 40 years after exposure, Pleural effusion, which is a collection that develops around the lung a few years after asbestos exposure, Lung cancer.

A pre-pregnancy serum folic acid test may also be done.", "Causes": "Anencephaly is one of the most common neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the tissue that grows into the spinal cord and brain.Anencephaly occurs early in the development of an unborn baby. It results when the upper part of the neural tube fails to close. Why this happens is not known. Possible causes include environmental toxins and low intake of folic acid by the mother during pregnancy.Anencephaly occurs in about 1 out of 10,000 births. The exact number is unknown, because many of these pregnancies result in miscarriage. Having one infant with this condition increases the risk of having another child with neural tube defects.", "Prevention": "It is important for women who may become pregnant to get enough folic acid.There is good evidence that folic acid can help reduce the risk of certain birth defects, including anencephaly. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should take a multivitamin with folic acid every day. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid to help prevent these kinds of birth defects.Getting enough folic acid can reduce the chance of neural tube defects by 50 percent.For specific recommendations, see folic acid (folate).", "Treatment": "There is no current therapy.

", "Treatment": "Infants who have breathing symptoms typically\u00a0need immediate surgery. Infants without severe symptoms typically have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life.Depending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve:Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect), Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta of the heart to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis), Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs . Types of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include:Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways, Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (reduction pulmonary arterioplasty), Rebuilding the windpipe and breathing tubes to the lungs, Replacing the abnormal pulmonary valve with one taken from human or animal tissue . Infants with severe breathing symptoms may need to get oxygen or be put on a breathing machine (ventilator).", "Causes": "Absent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not\u00a0form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. When present, it often occurs as part of a heart condition called tetralogy of Fallot.When the pulmonary valve is missing or does not work well, not enough blood can flow efficiently to the lungs to get oxygen.There is also usually a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body.The skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen.Absent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring air to the lungs (bronchi) and cause breathing problems.Other heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include:Abnormal tricuspid valve, Atrial septal defect, Double outlet right ventricle, Ductus arteriosis, Endocardial cushion defect, Marfan syndrome, Tricuspid atresia. Heart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects of the genes (chromosomes).", "Prevention": "Although there is no way to prevent this condition, families may be evaluated to determine their risk of congenital defects."}, "Aortic stenosis": {"Symptoms": ["Chest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw.

", "description": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart.\r\n", "Causes": "As the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain. As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body.Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life. Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth.Aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people. Calcification of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcification can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment).Another cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is becoming rarer in the United States.Aortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. It occurs more often in men than in women.", "Treatment": "Regular checkups by a health provider may be all that is needed if your symptoms are not severe. The health care provider should ask about your health history, do a physical exam, and perform an echocardiogram.People with severe aortic stenosis may be told not to play competitive sports, even if they have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, strenuous activity must often be limited.Medicines are used to treat symptoms of heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms (most commonly atrial fibrillation). These include diuretics (water pills), nitrates, and beta-blockers. High blood pressure should also be treated. If aortic stenosis is severe, this treatment must be done carefully so blood pressure does not drop too far.In the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or a procedure such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often before dental work and other procedures. Check with your health care provider to find out whether you need antibiotics.People with this and other heart conditions should stop smoking and be tested for high cholesterol.Surgery to repair or replace the valve is often done for adults or children who develop symptoms. Even if symptoms are not very bad, the doctor may recommend surgery based on test results.A less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done instead of surgery.A balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, threaded to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated. However, narrowing often occurs again after this procedure., A newer procedure done at the same time as valvuloplasty can implant an artificial valve. This procedure is most often done in patients who cannot have surgery, but it\u00a0is becoming more common. . Some children may need aortic valve repair or replacement.

It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure.You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your doctor prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered.For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using one cup of warm water, half a teaspoon of salt, and pinch of baking soda.Treatments for allergic rhinitis include:ANTIHISTAMINESMedicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following:Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription., Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this type of medicine., Others cause little or no sleepiness., Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your doctor if you should try these medicines first. . CORTICOSTEROIDSNasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis., They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time., Corticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults., Many brands are available. You can buy one brand without a prescription. For all other brands, you will need a prescription from your doctor. . DECONGESTANTSDecongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness., Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days. . OTHER MEDICINESLeukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. . ALLERGY SHOTSAllergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction.SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT)Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies.

Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old. Breastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it:Has less iron, Causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines, Makes it harder for the body to absorb iron.

The developing blood vessels in the heart do not connect correctly.In the normal heart, the left coronary artery starts in the aorta. The aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body.In children with ALCAPA, the left coronary artery starts at the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs.When this defect occurs, blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the left side of the heart. Therefore, the heart does not get enough oxygen. When the heart muscle is deprived of\u00a0oxygen, the tissue begins to die. This condition leads to a heart attack in the baby.A condition known as \"coronary steal\" further damages the heart in babies with ALCAPA.

There is often a family history of this condition.The term \"lazy eye\" refers to amblyopia, which often occurs along with strabismus. However, amblyopia can occur without strabismus. Also, people can have strabismus without amblyopia.Other causes include:Childhood cataracts, Farsightedness, nearsightedness, or astigmatism, especially if it is greater in one eye . ", "Prevention": "Identifying and treating the problem early prevents children from having permanent visual loss. All children should have a complete eye exam at least once between ages 3 and 5.Special methods are used to measure vision in a child who is too young to speak. Most eye care professionals can perform these techniques."}, "Alcohol use disorder": {"description": "Alcohol use disorder\u00a0is when your drinking causes serious problems in your life, yet you keep drinking.

It can also help you perform better at work or school.However, many people who drink too much find they cannot just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem.DECIDING TO QUITLike many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of hand. An important first step is to be aware of how much you drink. It also helps to understand the health risks of alcohol.If you decide to quit drinking, talk with your health care provider. Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives those around you. Depending on how much and how long you have been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life-threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a doctor. Talk with your health care provider about how to stop using alcohol.LONG-TERM SUPPORTAlcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer:Education about alcohol use\u00a0and its effects, Counseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviors, Physical health care . For the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems. Depending on your needs and the programs that are available:You may be treated in a special recovery center (inpatient), You may attend a program while you live at home (outpatient) . You may be prescribed medicines to help you quit. They are often used with long-term counseling or support groups.

This is called \"use or elimination testing.\" This is often used to check for food or medication allergies.The doctor may also check your reaction to physical triggers by applying heat, cold, or other stimulation to your body and watching for an allergic response.Sometimes, a suspected allergen is dissolved and dropped into the lower eyelid to check for an allergic reaction. This should only be done by a health care provider.", "Treatment": "Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use epinephrine, call 911 and go straight to the hospital.The best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and drug allergies.There are several types of medications to prevent and treat allergies. Which medicine your doctor recommends depends on the type and severity of your symptoms, your age, and overall health.Illnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema) may need other treatments.Medications that can be used to treat allergies include:ANTIHISTAMINESAntihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are available in many forms, including:Capsules and pills, Eye drops, Injection, Liquid, Nasal spray . CORTICOSTEROIDSThese are anti-inflammatory medications. They are available in many forms, including:Creams and ointment for the skin, Eye drops, Nasal spray, Lung inhaler . Persons with severe allergic symptoms may be prescribed corticosteroid pills or injections for short periods.DECONGESTANTSDecongestants help relieve a stuffy nose. Do not use decongestant nasal spray for more than several days because they can cause a rebound effect and make the congestion worse. Decongestants in pill form do not cause this problem. People with high blood pressure, heart problems, or prostate enlargement should use decongestants with caution.OTHER MEDICINESLeukotriene inhibitors are medicines that block the substances that trigger allergies. Person with asthma and indoor and outdoor allergies may be prescribed these medicines.ALLERGY SHOTSAllergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. Allergy shots keep your body from over-reacting to the allergen. You will get regular injections of the allergen. Each dose is slightly larger than the last dose until a maximum dose is reached. These shots do not work for everybody and you will have to visit the doctor often.SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT)Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies.", "Causes": "Allergies are very common. Both genes and environment play a role. If both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you have them, too.The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens. These are usually harmless and in most people do not cause a problem.In a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.Watch this video about:AllergiesCommon allergens include:Drugs, Dust, Food, Insect venom, Mold, Pet and other animal dander, Pollen . Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers. Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.Allergies may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema, and asthma, worse.", "Prevention": "Breastfeeding can help prevent\u00a0or decrease allergies when you feed babies this way only for 4 to 6 months. However, changing a mother's diet during pregnancy or while breastfeeding does not seem to help prevent allergies.For most children, changing the diet or using special formulas does not seem to prevent allergies. If a parent, brother, sister, or other family member has a history of eczema and allergies, discuss feeding with your child's doctor. There is also evidence that being exposed to certain allergens (such as dust mites and cat dander) in the first year of life may prevent some allergies. This is called the \"hygiene hypothesis.\" It came from the observation that infants on farms tend to have fewer allergies than those who grow up in more sterile environments. However, older children do not seem to benefit.Once allergies have developed, treating the allergies and carefully avoiding allergy triggers can prevent reactions in the future."}, "Acute myeloid leukemia": {"description": "Acute means the disease develops quickly and usually has an aggressive course.", "Symptoms": ["Bleeding from the nose", "Bleeding gums", "Bruising", "Bone pain or tenderness", "Fatigue", "Fever", "Heavy menstrual periods", "Pallor", "Shortness of breath (gets worse with exercise)", "Skin rash or lesion", "Swollen gums (rare)", "Weight loss"], "Exams and Tests": "The doctor will perform a physical exam. There may be signs of a swollen spleen, liver, or lymph nodes.A complete blood count (CBC) may show anemia and a low number of platelets. A white blood cell count (WBC) can be high, low, or normal.Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will show if there are any leukemia cells.If your doctor learns you do have this type of leukemia, further tests will be done to determine the specific type of AML. Subtypes are based on specific genetic changes or mutations and how the leukemia cells appear under the microscope. ", "Causes": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults. This type of cancer is rare under age 40. AML is more common in men than women.Persons with this type of cancer have an abundance of abnormal immature cells inside their bone marrow. The cells grow very quickly, and replace healthy blood cells. The bone marrow, which helps the body fight infections and makes other blood components, eventually stops working correctly. Persons with AML are more likely to have infections and have an increased risk of bleeding as the numbers of healthy blood cells decrease.Most of the time, a doctor cannot tell you what caused AML. However, the following things\u00a0can lead to some types of leukemia, including AML:\r\n  Blood disorders, including polycythemia vera, thrombocythemia, and myelodysplasia\r\n  , \r\n  Certain chemicals (for example, benzene)\r\n  , \r\n  Certain chemotherapy drugs, including etoposide and drugs known as alkylating agents\r\n  , \r\n  Exposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances\r\n  , \r\n  Radiation\r\n  , \r\n  Weakened immune system due to an organ transplant\r\n  . Problems with your genes may also play a role in the development of AML.\r\n\u00a0", "Prevention": "If you work around radiation or chemicals linked to leukemia, you should always wear protective gear.", "Treatment": "Treatment involves using medicines (chemotherapy) to kill the cancer cells. Most types of AML are treated the same way in the beginning, with more than one chemotherapy drug.Chemotherapy kills normal cells, too. This may cause side effects such as:Increased risk of bleeding, Increased risk of infection (your doctor may want to keep you away from other people to prevent infection), Weight loss (you will need to eat extra calories), Mouth sores. Other supportive treatments for AML may include:Antibiotics to treat infection, Red blood cell transfusions to fight anemia, Transfusions of platelets to control bleeding . A bone marrow (stem cell) transplant will likely be done after your first or second round of chemotherapy. This decision is determined by several factors, including: Your age and overall health, How high your white blood cell count was, Certain genetic changes in the leukemia cells, The availability of donors.

Blood pressure may be normal or low.An ECG (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart) may show atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.If your abnormal heart rhythm comes and goes, you may need to wear a special monitor to diagnose the problem. The monitor records the heart's rhythms over a period of time.Event monitor, Holter monitor (24-hour test), Implanted loop recorder, Extended monitoring. Tests to find heart disease may include:Echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging of the heart), Tests to examine the blood supply of the heart muscle, Tests to study the heart's electrical system. ", "Causes": "When working well, the four chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way.The electrical signal that tells your heart to contract begins in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). These signals help your heart pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs.In atrial fibrillation, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular. Parts of the heart cannot contract in an organized\u00a0pattern., As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. . In atrial flutter, the ventricles (lower heart chambers) may beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern. These problems can affect both men and women. They become more common with increasing age.Common\u00a0causes of atrial fibrillation include:Alcohol use (especially binge drinking)\u00a0, Coronary artery disease, Heart attack or heart bypass surgery, Heart failure or an enlarged heart, Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve), Hypertension, Medicines, Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), Pericarditis, Sick sinus syndrome.

Avoid binge drinking.", "Treatment": "Cardioversion treatment is used to get the heart back into a normal rhythm right away. There are two options for treatment: Electric shocks to your heart, Drugs given through a vein . These treatments may be done as an emergency, or planned ahead of time.Daily medicines taken by mouth are used to:Slow the irregular heartbeat. These drugs may include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin., Prevent atrial fibrillation from coming back. These drugs work well in many people, but they can have serious side effects. Atrial fibrillation returns in many people, even while they are\u00a0taking these medicines. . Blood thinners are medicines that are used to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot\u00a0that travels\u00a0in the body (such as a stroke). They include heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and dabigatran (Pradaxa).These drugs increase the chance of bleeding, so not everyone can use them. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel may also be prescribed. Your doctor will consider your age and other medical problems when deciding which drugs are best.A procedure called radiofrequency ablation can be used to\u00a0scar areas in your heart where the heart rhythm problems are triggered. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals that cause atrial fibrillation from moving through the heart. You may need a heart pacemaker after this procedure.All people with atrial fibrillation will need to learn how to manage this condition at home."}, "Arrhenoblastoma of ovary": {"description": "See also: Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor", "Possible Complications": "Complications of surgery , Masculine symptoms (virilization), Spread of the tumor if it is not completely removed.

Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.An autoimmune disorder may result in:The destruction of body tissue, Abnormal growth of an organ, Changes in organ function. An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:Blood vessels, Connective tissues, Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas, Joints, Muscles, Red blood cells, Skin.

You need to start taking the medicine within 48 hours after your symptoms start for it to work.Oseltamivir may also be prescribed for persons who live in the same house people with avian flu. This may prevent them from getting the illness.The virus that causes human avian flu is resistant to the antiviral medicines amantadine and rimantadine. These medicines should not be used in the case of an H5N1 outbreak occurs.People with severe infection may need to be placed on a breathing machine. People infected with the virus also should be kept separate from non-infected people. Health care providers recommend that people get an influenza (flu) shot. This may cut down the chance that the avian flu virus will mix with a human flu virus. This might create a new virus that may easily spread.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a vaccine to protect humans from the avian flu.

The outbreak was linked to chickens.Since then there have been human cases of avian influenza A in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Pacific, and the near East. Hundreds of people have become sick with this virus. Up to half of the people who get this virus die from the illness.Between December 15, 2014, and May 29, 2015 there have been more than 200 cases of birds infected with highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5.Most of these infections have occurred in both backyard and commercial poultry flocks., These recent HPAI H5 viruses have not yet infected any people in the United States.. The chance of a worldwide outbreak in humans goes up the more the avian flu virus spreads. Your risk of getting the bird flu virus is higher if: You work with poultry (such as farmers), You travel to countries where the virus is present, You touch an infected bird, You go into a building with sick or dead birds, feces, or litter from infected birds, You eat raw or undercooked poultry meat, eggs, or blood from infected birds . No one has gotten avian flu virus from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products.Health care workers and people who live in the same house as people with bird flu may also be at higher risk of infection.

MEDICINESMedicines may be prescribed along with lifestyle changes. All medicines have some risks. You should be closely followed by a doctor when taking arthritis medicines.Over-the-counter medicines: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is often the first medicine tried. Take up to 4000 mg a day (two arthritis-strength Tylenol every 8 hours). To prevent damage to your liver, do not take more than the recommended dose. Since multiple medications are available without a prescription that also contain acetaminophen, you will need to include them in the 4000 mg per day maximum. Also, avoid alcohol\u00a0when taking\u00a0acetaminophen., Aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can relieve arthritis pain. However, they can carry risks when used for a long time. Possible side effects include heart attack, stroke, stomach ulcers, bleeding from the digestive tract, and kidney damage. . Prescription medicines:Biologics are used for the treatment of autoimmune arthritis. They include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), abatacept (Orencia), rituximab (Rituxan), golimumab (Simponi), certolizumab (Cimzia), and tocilizumab (Actemra). These drugs can improve the quality of life for many patients, but can have serious side effects., Corticosteroids (\"steroids\") help reduce inflammation. They may be injected into painful joints or given by mouth., Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat autoimmune arthritis. They include methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and leflunomide., Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide are used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis when other medications have not worked., For gout, allopurinol (Zyloprim) or febuxostat (Uloric) may be used to lower uric acid. . It is very important to take your medicines as directed by your doctor. If you are having problems doing so (for example, because of side effects), you should talk to your doctor. Also make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines you are taking, including vitamins and supplements bought without a prescription.SURGERY AND OTHER TREATMENTSIn some cases, surgery may be done if other treatments have not worked.

", "Treatment": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition and needs to be treated right away.Dissections that occur in the part of the aorta that is leaving the heart (ascending) are treated with surgery., Dissections that occur in other parts of the aorta (descending) may be managed with surgery or medicines. . Two techniques may be used for surgery:Standard, open surgery. This requires a surgical incision that\u00a0is made in the chest or abdomen., Endovascuar aortic repair. This surgery is done without any major surgical incisions. . Drugs that lower blood pressure may be prescribed. These drugs may be given through a vein (intravenously). Beta-blockers are the first drugs of choice. Strong pain relievers are very often needed.If the aortic valve is damaged, valve replacement is needed. If the heart arteries are involved, a coronary bypass is also performed.", "Causes": "When it leaves the heart, the aorta first moves up through the chest towards the head (the ascending aorta). It then bends or arches, and finally moves down through the chest and abdomen (the descending aorta).Aortic dissection most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This very often occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal aorta.When a tear occurs, it creates two channels: One in which blood continues to travel, Another where blood stays still . If the channel with non-traveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta. This can narrow the other branches and reduce blood flow through them.An aortic dissection may also cause abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta (aneurysm).The exact cause is unknown, but more common risks include: Aging, Atherosclerosis, Blunt trauma to the chest, such as hitting the steering wheel of a car during an accident, High blood pressure. Other risk factors and conditions linked to aortic dissection include:\r\n  Bicuspid aortic valve\r\n  , Coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta, Connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and rare genetic disorders\r\n  , Heart surgery or procedures, Pregnancy, \r\n  Swelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis\r\n  . Aortic dissection occurs in about 2 out of every 10,000 people. It can affect anyone, but is most often seen in men ages 40 to 70.", "Prevention": "Many cases of aortic dissection cannot be prevented.Things you can do to reduce your risk include:Treating and controlling hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), Keeping high blood pressure under control, especially if you are at risk for dissection, Taking safety precautions to prevent injuries that can cause dissections, If you have been diagnosed with Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, making sure you regularly follow-up with your doctor .

Acute mountain sickness is easier to treat in the early stages.The main treatment for all forms of mountain sickness is to climb down (descend) to a lower altitude as rapidly and safely as possible. You should not continue climbing if you develop symptoms.Extra oxygen should be given, if available.People with severe mountain sickness may need to be admitted to a hospital.Acetazolamide (Diamox) may be given to help you breathe better. It can help reduce mild symptoms. This medicine can make you urinate more often. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol when taking this drug. This medication works best when taken before reaching a high altitude.If you have fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema), treatment may include:Oxygen, A high blood pressure medicine called nifedipine, Beta agonist inhalers to open the airways, Breathing machine in severe cases, Medicine to increase blood flow to the lungs called phosphodiesterase inhibitor (such as sildenafil). Dexamethasone (Decadron) may help reduce swelling in the brain (cerebral edema).Portable hyperbaric chambers allow hikers to simulate conditions at lower altitudes without actually moving from their location on the mountain. These devices are very helpful if bad weather or other factors make climbing down the mountain impossible.", "Causes": "Acute mountain sickness is caused by\u00a0reduced air pressure and lower oxygen levels at high altitudes.The faster you climb to a high altitude, the more likely you will get acute mountain sickness. You are at higher risk for acute mountain sickness if:You live at or near sea level and travel to a high altitude, You have had the illness before. ", "Prevention": "Keys to preventing acute mountain sickness include:Climb the mountain gradually, Stop for a day or two of rest for every 2,000 feet (600 meters) above 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), Sleep at a lower altitude when possible, Learn how to recognize early symptoms of mountain sickness. If you are traveling above 9,840 feet (3,000 meters), you should carry enough oxygen for several days.If you plan on quickly climbing to a high altitude, ask your doctor about a medication called acetazolamide (Diamox). This drug helps your body get used to higher altitudes more quickly, and reduces minor symptoms. It should be taken the day before you climb, and then for the next 1 to 2 days.If you are at risk for a low red blood cell count (anemia), ask your doctor if an iron supplement is right for you. Anemia lowers the amount of oxygen in your blood. This makes you more likely to have mountain sickness.While climbing:Drink plenty of fluids, Avoid alcohol, Eat regular meals, high in carbohydrates.

Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.Most often, healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (epo) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their red color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin.The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients because:Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease), Poor diet, Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers), Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines .
