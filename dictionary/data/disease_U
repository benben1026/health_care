It often happens\u00a0when a baby is still growing in the womb. This is called a congenital condition (present from birth). The blockage is caused when there is a narrowing of area between the ureter and the part of the kidney called the renal pelvis. Urine can build up and damage the kidney as a result.The condition can also be an abnormal blood vessel over the ureter. In older children and adults, the problem may be due to scar tissue, infection, earlier treatments for a blockage, or kidney stones.UPJ obstruction is the cause of most urinary obstructions in children. It is now commonly detected before birth with\u00a0ultrasound tests. In some cases, the condition may not show up until after birth.

Some therapists place a sensor in the vagina (for women) or the anus (for men) so they can tell when they are squeezing the pelvic floor muscles., A monitor will display a graph showing which muscles are squeezing and which are at rest., The therapist can help you find the right muscles for performing Kegel exercises. . Electrical stimulation. This uses a gentle electrical current to contract your bladder muscles. The current is delivered using an anal or vaginal probe., This therapy may be done at the health care provider's office or at home., Treatment sessions usually last 20 minutes and may be done every 1 - 4 days. . LIFESTYLE CHANGESPay attention to how much water you drink and when you drink.Drinking enough water will help keep odors away., Drink a little bit of fluid at a time throughout the day, so your bladder does not need to handle a large amount of urine at one time. Drink less than 8 ounces at one time., Do not drink large amounts of fluids with meals., Sip small amounts of fluids between meals., Stop drinking fluids about 2 hours before bedtime., Avoid carbonated drinks. . It also may help to stop eating foods that may irritate the bladder, such as:Caffeine, Highly acidic foods, such as citrus fruits and juices, Spicy foods . Avoid activities that irritate the urethra and bladder. This includes taking bubble baths or using harsh soaps.MEDICATIONMedications used to treat urge incontinence relax bladder contractions and help improve bladder function. There are several types of medications that may be used alone or together:Anticholinergic medicines help relax the muscles of the bladder. They include oxybutynin (Oxytrol, Ditropan), tolterodine (Detrol), darifenacin (Enablex), trospium (Sanctura), and solifenacin (Vesicare)., Flavoxate (Urispas) is a drug that calms muscle spasms. However, studies have shown that it is not always effective at controlling symptoms of urge incontinence., Tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine, doxepin) help \"paralyze\" the smooth muscle of the bladder. . These medicines may have side effects such as dizziness or dry mouth. Talk with your doctor if you notice bothersome side effects.If you have an infection, your health care provider will prescribe antibiotics. Be sure to take the entire amount as directed.SURGERYSurgery can help your bladder store more urine. It can also help relieve the pressure on your bladder. Surgery is only used for people who have too many spasms and are not able to store much urine.Augmentation cystoplasty is the surgery most often performed for severe urge incontinence. In this surgery, a part of the bowel is added to the bladder. This increases the bladder size and allows it to store more urine.Possible complications include:Blood clots, Bowel obstruction, Infection, Pneumonia, Slightly increased risk of tumors. There is a risk of forming tube-like passages from the bladder to other organs or your skin. These are called urinary fistulae. They can lead to:Urine draining out in an unusual way, such as from your vagina, Urinary tract infection, Difficulty urinating . Sacral nerve stimulation is a newer type of surgery. A small unit is implanted under your skin. This sends small electrical pulses to the sacral nerve (one of the nerves that comes out at the base of your spine), The electrical pulses can be adjusted to help relieve your symptoms. . Urinary incontinence is a long-term (chronic) problem. While treatments can cure your condition, you should still to see your health care provider to make sure you are doing well and check for possible problems.", "Causes": "As your bladder fills with urine from the kidneys, it stretches to allow urine. You should feel the first urge to urinate when there is a bit less than 1 cup of urine in your bladder. Most people can hold more than 2 cups of urine in the bladder.Two muscles help prevent the flow of urine:The sphincter is a muscle around the opening of the bladder. It squeezes to prevent urine from leaking into the urethra. This is the tube that urine passes through from your bladder to the outside., The bladder wall muscle relaxes so the bladder can expand. . When you urinate, the bladder wall muscle squeezes to force urine out of the bladder. As this happens, the sphincter muscle relaxes to allow the urine to pass through. All of these systems must work together to control urination: Your bladder muscles and other parts of your urinary tract, The nerves controlling your urinary system, Your ability to feel and respond to the urge to urinate . The bladder may contract too often from nervous system problems or bladder irritation.Watch this video about:Bladder function - neurological controlURGE INCONTINENCEWith urge incontinence, you leak urine because the bladder muscles squeeze, or contract, at the wrong times. Often these contractions occur no matter how much urine is in the bladder.Urge incontinence may result from:Bladder cancer, Bladder inflammation, Something blocking urine from leaving the bladder, Bladder stones, Infection, Brain or nerve problems, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke, Nerve injury, such as from a spinal cord injury. In men, urge incontinence also may be due to:Bladder changes caused by an enlarged prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), An enlarged prostate blocking urine from flowing from the bladder . In most cases of urge incontinence, no cause can be found.Although urge incontinence may occur in anyone at any age, it is more common in women and older adults.", "Prevention": "Starting bladder retraining techniques early may help relieve your symptoms."}, "Unstable angina": {"description": "Angina is a type of chest discomfort caused by poor blood flow through the blood vessels (coronary vessels) of the heart muscle (myocardium).", "Possible Complications": "Unstable angina may lead to:Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), A heart attack, Heart failure.

The doctor may hear abnormal sounds, such as a heart murmur or irregular heartbeat, when listening to your chest with a stethoscope.Tests for angina include:Blood tests to show if you have heart tissue damage or are at a high risk for heart attack, including troponin I and T-00745, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and myoglobin, ECG, Echocardiography, Stress tests, such as exercise tolerance test (stress test or treadmill test), nuclear stress test, or stress echocardiogram, Coronary angiography. This test involves taking pictures of the heart arteries using x-rays and dye. It is the most direct test to diagnose heart artery narrowing and find clots. ", "Treatment": "Your doctor may want you to check into the hospital to get some rest, have more tests, and prevent complications.Blood thinners (antiplatelet drugs) are used to treat and prevent unstable angina. You will receive these drugs as soon as possible if you can take them safely. Medicines include aspirin and the prescription drug clopidogrel or something similar. These medicines may be able to reduce the chance of a heart attack or the severity of a heart attack that occurs.During an unstable angina event:You may get heparin (or another blood thinner) and nitroglycerin (under the tongue or through an IV), Other treatments may include medicines to control blood pressure, anxiety, abnormal heart rhythms, and cholesterol (such as a statin drug) . A procedure called angioplasty and stenting can often be done to open a blocked or narrowed arteryAngioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart., A coronary artery stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is often placed after angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. A drug-eluting stent has medicine in it that helps prevent the artery from closing. . Heart bypass surgery may be done for some people. The decision to have this surgery depends on:Which arteries are blocked, How many arteries are involved , Which parts of the coronary arteries are narrowed , How severe the narrowings are. ", "Causes": "Coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis is the most common cause of unstable angina. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fatty material, called plaque, along the walls of the arteries. This causes arteries to become narrowed and less flexible. The narrowing interrupts blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain.People with unstable angina are at higher risk of having a heart attack.Rare causes of angina are:Abnormal function of tiny branch arteries without narrowing of larger arteries (called microvascular dysfunction or Syndrome X), Coronary artery spasm. Risk factors for coronary artery disease include:Diabetes, Family history of early coronary heart disease (a close relative such as a sibling or parent had heart disease before age 55 in a man or before age 65 in a woman), High blood pressure, High LDL cholesterol, Low HDL cholesterol, Male gender, Not getting enough exercise, Obesity, Older age, Smoking . ", "Prevention": "Some studies have shown that making a few lifestyle changes can prevent blockages from getting worse and may actually improve them. Lifestyle changes can also help prevent some angina attacks. Your doctor may tell you to:Lose weight if you are overweight., Stop smoking., Exercise regularly., Drink alcohol in moderation only., Eat a healthy diet that is high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and lean meats.. Your doctor will also recommend that you keep other health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels under control. If you have one or more risk factors for heart disease, talk to your doctor about taking aspirin or other medicines to help prevent a heart attack. Aspirin therapy (75 - 325 mg a day) or drugs such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel may help prevent heart attacks in some people. Aspirin therapy is recommended if the benefit is likely to outweigh the risk of side effects."}, "Unilateral hydronephrosis": {"description": "Unilateral hydronephrosis is swelling of one kidney due to a backup of urine.", "Possible Complications": "If hydronephrosis is left untreated, the affected kidney may be permanently damaged.

Both local and body-wide disorders may damage just one nerve.The usual causes of mononeuropathy are:An illness in the whole body that damages a single nerve, Direct injury to the nerve, Long-term pressure on the nerve, Pressure on the nerve caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures. Ulnar neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the ulnar nerve, which travels down the arm. The ulnar nerve is near the surface of the body where it crosses the elbow. The damage destroys the nerve covering (myelin sheath) or part of the nerve (axon). This damage slows or prevents nerve signaling.Damage to the ulnar nerve can be caused by:Long-term pressure on the elbow, An elbow fracture or dislocation.

It can also be caused by\u00a0infection or exposure to toxins. In many cases, the cause is unknown.The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis. This involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it usually only affects the iris, the colored part of the eye. The inflammation may be linked with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the uvea. It involves primarily the choroid, which is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle part of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. You may develop this condition if you have had a body-wide (systemic) infection or if you have an autoimmune disease.Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. This inflammation affects the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn's disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.Uveitis can be associated with any of the following:AIDS, Ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet syndrome, CMV retinitis, Herpes zoster infection, Histoplasmosis, Injury, Kawasaki disease, Psoriasis, Reactive arthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Sarcoidosis, Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis, Tuberculosis, Ulcerative colitis.

The infection most commonly develops in the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk of having UTIs.Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk of a UTI.The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI:Diabetes, Advanced age and conditions that affect personal care habits (such as Alzheimer disease and delirium), Problems emptying the bladder completely, Having a urinary catheter, Bowel incontinence, Enlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urine, Kidney stones, Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture), Pregnancy, Surgery or other procedure involving the urinary tract .
