These cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a cloudy cornea.At first, fluid may build up only during sleep, when the eye is closed.

Until recently, the most common type of corneal transplant was penetrating keratoplasty. During this procedure, a small round piece of the cornea is removed, leaving an opening in the front of the eye. A matching piece of cornea from a human donor is then sewn into the opening in the front of the eye.A newer technique called endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK, DSAEK, or DMEK) has become the preferred option for patients with Fuchs' dystrophy. In this procedure, only the inner layers of the cornea are replaced, instead of all the layers. This leads to a faster recovery and fewer complications.

Prolonged pressure on the nerve decreases blood flow in the area. This can lead to further complications.The femoral nerve can be also be damaged if you have: A broken pelvis bone, A catheter placed into the femoral artery in the groin, Diabetes, which can cause widespread nerve damage, Internal bleeding in the pelvis or belly area (abdomen) . One common risk factor is lying on the back with the thighs and legs flexed and turned (\"lithotomy\" position) during surgery or diagnostic procedures. Branches of the femoral nerve can be compressed by tight or heavy waist belts. People who lose or gain a lot of weight may be at greater risk of femoral nerve injury.

If you do not take in enough fluids or water, you become dehydrated.Your body may also have a hard time excreting (getting rid of) fluids. As a result, excess fluid builds up in the body. This is called fluid overload (volume overload). This can lead to edema (excess fluid in the skin).Many medical problems can cause fluid imbalance:It is common to retain large amounts of fluid for several days after surgery (causing swelling of the body)., In heart failure, fluid collects in the lungs, liver, blood vessels, and body tissues because the heart does a poor job of pumping it to the kidneys, where it can be eliminated., When the kidneys do not work well because of chronic kidney disease, the body cannot get rid of unneeded fluids., The body may lose too much fluid due to diarrhea, vomiting, excessive blood loss, or high fever., Lack of a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) can cause the kidneys to get rid of too much fluid. This results in extreme thirst and dehydration. . A fluid imbalance is often associated with imbalances of sodium (hyponatremia, hypernatremia), potassium (hypokalemia, \u00a0hyperkalemia), and other chemicals that help regulate body fluids.Medicines can also affect fluid balance. The most common are water pills (diuretics) to treat blood pressure.", "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the specific condition that is causing the fluid imbalance."}, "Fish tapeworm": {"description": "Fish tapeworm is an infection with a parasite found in fish.", "Possible Complications": "Megaloblastic anemia, Intestinal blockage (rare).

After a person has eaten infected fish, the larva begin to grow in the intestine. Larvae are fully grown in 3 - 6 weeks. The adult worm, which is segmented, may reach a length of 30 feet. Eggs are formed in each segment of the worm and are passed in the stool. Sometimes, parts of the worm may also be passed in the stool.Fish tapeworm infection may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia."}, "Facial tics": {"description": "A facial tic is a repeated spasm, often involving the eyes and muscles of the face.", "Possible Complications": "In most cases, there are no complications.", "Symptoms": ["Eye blinking", "Grimacing", "Mouth twitching", "Nose wrinkling", "Squinting"], "Exams and Tests": "The health care provider will usually diagnose a tic during a physical examination.

Calling the child's attention to a tic may make it worse or cause it to continue. A non-stressful environment can make tics occur less often, and help them go away more quickly.
