Make sure your dentist and hygienist know that you have diabetes. . ", "Treatment": "Because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.If you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you may need to have a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. Your doctor will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. Your doctor will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. It may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedules.As your diabetes becomes more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. Visiting your doctor is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.You are the most important person in managing your diabetes. You should know the basic steps of diabetes management, including:How to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), How to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), How to plan meals, including carbohydrate (carb) counting, How to give insulin, How to check blood glucose and urine ketones, How to adjust insulin and food when you exercise, How to handle sick days, Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them . INSULINInsulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. Everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.Insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump. It cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.Insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. Your doctor will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it. Some types of insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. Other types of insulin should never be mixed. You may need insulin shots 1 to 4 times a day.Your doctor or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. At first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or another adult. By age 14, most children can give themselves their\u00a0own injections.People with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:When they exercise, When they are sick, When they will be eating more or less food and calories, When they are traveling . HEALTHY EATING AND EXERCISEBy testing your blood sugar level, you can learn which foods and activities raise or lower your blood sugar level the most. This helps you adjust your insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or too low.The American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. It also helps to talk to a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.Regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. It also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach and maintain a healthy weight.Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGARChecking your blood sugar level yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your health care team. These numbers will help if you have problems managing your diabetes. You and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. You should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.Talk to your doctor about your target for the A1C test. This lab test shows\u00a0your\u00a0average blood sugar level over the past 3 months. It shows how well you are controlling your diabetes. For most persons with type 1 diabetes, the A1C target should be 7.5% or lower.Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL\u00a0is too low and can harm you.FOOT CAREPeople with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. You may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.To prevent problems with your feet:Stop smoking if you smoke., Improve control of your blood sugar., Get a foot exam at least twice a year with your doctor, and learn whether you have nerve damage., Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems., Treat minor infections, such as athlete's foot, right away., Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin., Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your doctor what kind is\u00a0right for you. . PREVENTING COMPLICATIONSYour doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chances of developing common complications of diabetes, including:Eye disease, Kidney disease, Heart disease and stroke. With type 1 diabetes, you are also at risk of developing conditions such as hearing loss, gum disease, or yeast infections (in women). Keeping your blood sugar under good control can help prevent these conditions.Talk with your health care team about other things you can do to lower your chances of developing diabetes.", "Causes": "Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. It is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults.Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. With type 1 diabetes, beta cells produce little or no insulin.Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. This buildup of glucose in the blood is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes.The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Most likely it is an autoimmune disorder. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. With type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the cells in the pancreas that make insulin.

These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include:How to test and record your blood glucose, What and when to eat, How to safely increase your activity and control your weight, How to take medications, if needed, How to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar, How to handle sick days, Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them . It may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well\u00a0with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments.MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGARChecking your blood sugar levels yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.Your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind:Most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day., If your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week., You may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime., You may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress. . Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range. HEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROLWork closely with your doctor, nurse, and dietitian to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.Managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes.Very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITYRegular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it:Lowers your blood sugar level without medicine, Burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight, Improves blood flow and blood pressure, Increases your energy level, Improves your ability to handle stress . Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.MEDICATIONS TO TREAT DIABETESIf diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medication. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.Some of the most common types of medication are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection.Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, Biguanides, DPP IV inhibitors, Injectable medicines (GLP-1 analogs), Meglitinides, SGL T2 inhibitors, Sulfonylureas, Thiazolidinediones . You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. It cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.PREVENTING COMPLICATIONSYour doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including: Eye disease, Kidney disease, Heart disease and stroke. FOOT CAREPeople with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. You many not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.To prevent problems with your feet:Stop smoking if you smoke., Improve control of your blood sugar., Get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year and learn if you have nerve damage., Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems., Treat minor infections, such as athlete's foot, right away., Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin., Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your doctor what type of shoe is right for you. . ", "Causes": "Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and\u00a0behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia.Type 2 diabetes usually occurs slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in the elderly.Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.

Transposition of the great vessels is a cyanotic heart defect. This means there is decreased oxygen in the blood that is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body. In normal hearts, blood that returns from the body goes through the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen.

Dosage depends on your condition and\u00a0may be very high while the tissue is being rejected.\u00a0After you no longer have signs of rejection, the dosage will likely\u00a0be lowered.", "Causes": "Your body's immune system usually protects you from substances that may be harmful, such as germs, poisons, and sometimes cancer cells.These harmful substances have proteins called antigens coating their surfaces. As soon as these antigens enter the body, the immune system recognizes that they are not from that person's body and that they are \"foreign,\" and attacks them.When a person receives an organ from someone else during transplant surgery, that person's immune system may recognize that it is foreign. This is because the person's immune system detects that the antigens on the cells of the organ are different or not \"matched.\" Mismatched organs, or\u00a0organs that are not matched closely enough, can trigger a blood transfusion reaction or transplant rejection. To help prevent this reaction, doctors type, or match both the organ donor and the person who is receiving the organ. The more similar the antigens are between the donor and recipient, the less likely that the organ will be rejected.Tissue typing ensures that the organ or tissue is as similar as possible to the tissues of the recipient. The match is usually not perfect. No two people, except identical twins, have identical tissue antigens.Doctors use\u00a0medicines to suppress the recipient's immune system. The goal is to prevent the immune system from attacking the newly transplanted organ when the organ is not closely matched. If these\u00a0medicines are not used, the body will almost always launch an immune response and destroy the foreign tissue.There are some exceptions, though. Cornea transplants are rarely rejected because the cornea has no blood supply. Also, transplants from one identical twin to another are almost never rejected.There are three types of rejection:Hyperacute rejection occurs a few minutes after the transplant when the antigens are completely unmatched. The tissue must be removed right away so the recipient does not die. This type of rejection is seen when a recipient is given the wrong type of blood. For example, when a person is given type A blood when he or she is type B., Acute rejection may occur any time from the first week after the transplant to 3 months afterward.\u00a0All recipients have some amount of acute rejection., Chronic rejection can take place over many years. The body's constant immune response against the new organ slowly damages the transplanted tissues or organ..

If the tricuspid valve does not open, the blood cannot flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Because of the problem with the tricuspid valve, blood ultimately cannot enter the lungs, where it must go to pick up oxygen (becomes oxygenated).Instead, the blood passes through a hole between the right and left atrium.\u00a0In the left atrium, it mixes with oxygenated blood returning from the lungs. This mix of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood is then pumped out into the body, which causes oxygen levels in the blood to be lower than normal.The lungs receive blood either through a hole between the right and left ventricles, or through a fetal vessel called the ductus arteriosus that connects the pulmonary artery (artery to the lungs) to the aorta (main artery to the body).

If you think you may want to have children in the future, ask your doctor about methods to save your sperm for use at a later date.", "Symptoms": ["Discomfort or pain in the testicle, or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum", "Pain in the back or lower abdomen", "Enlarged testicle or a change in the way it feels", "Excess\u00a0amount of breast tissue (gynecomastia), however\u00a0this can occur normally in adolescent\u00a0boys who do not have testicular cancer", "Lump or swelling in either testicle"], "Exams and Tests": "A physical examination typically\u00a0reveals a firm lump (mass) in one of the testicles. When the health care provider holds a flashlight up to the scrotum, the light does not pass through the lump.Other tests include:Abdominal and pelvic CT scan, Blood tests for tumor markers: alpha fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta HCG), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), Chest x-ray, Ultrasound of the scrotum. ", "Treatment": "\r\nTreatment depends on the:Type of testicular tumor, Stage of the tumor. Once cancer is found, the first step is to determine the type of cancer cell by examining it under a microscope. The cells can be seminoma, nonseminoma, or both.The next step is to determine how far the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This is called \"staging.\"Stage I cancer has not spread beyond the testicle., Stage II cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen., Stage III cancer has spread beyond the lymph nodes (it could be as far as the liver, lungs, or brain).. Three types of treatment can be used.Surgical treatment removes the testicle (orchiectomy) and may also remove nearby lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy). This is usually performed in the case of both seminoma and nonseminomas., Radiation therapy using high-dose x-rays or other high-energy rays may be used after surgery to prevent the tumor from returning. Radiation therapy is usually only used for treating seminomas., Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. This treatment has greatly improved survival for patients with both seminomas and nonseminomas.. ", "Causes": "The exact cause of testicular cancer is unknown.\u00a0 Factors that may increase a man's risk of developing testicular cancer increases if he has:\u00a0Abnormal testicle development, Exposure to certain chemicals, Family history of testicular cancer, HIV infection, History of testicular cancer, History of an\u00a0undescended testicle\r\n (one or both testicles fail to move into the scrotum before birth), Klinefelter syndrome. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. It can occur in older men, and\u00a0in rare cases,\u00a0in younger boys.White men\u00a0are more likely than African American and Asian American men to develop this type of cancer.\u00a0\u00a0There is no link between vasectomy and testicular cancer.\r\nThere are two main types of testicular cancer, seminomas and nonseminomas. These cancers grow from germ cells, the cells that make sperm.Seminoma: This is a slow-growing form of testicular cancer usually found in men in their 30s and 40s. The cancer is usually just in the testes, but it can spread to the lymph nodes. Seminomas are very sensitive to radiation therapy.Nonseminoma: This more common type of testicular cancer tends to grow more quickly than seminomas.Nonseminoma tumors are often made up of more than one type of cell, and are identified according to these different cell types:Choriocarcinoma (rare), Embryonal carcinoma, Teratoma, Yolk sac tumor. A stromal tumor is a rare type of testicular tumor. They are usually not cancerous. The two main types of stromal tumors are Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors. Stromal tumors usually occur during childhood.", "Prevention": "Performing a testicular self-examination (TSE) each month may help detect testicular cancer at an early stage, before it spreads. Finding testicular cancer early is important to successful treatment and survival."}, "Typhoid fever": {"description": "Typhoid fever is an infection that causes diarrhea and a rash. It is\u00a0most commonly due to a type of bacterium called Salmonella typhi (S. typhi).", "Possible Complications": "Intestinal hemorrhage (severe GI bleeding)\r\n, Intestinal perforation\r\n, Kidney failure, Peritonitis. ", "Symptoms": ["Abdominal tenderness", "Agitation", "Bloody stools", "Chills", "Confusion", "Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit)", "Delirium", "Fluctuating mood", "Hallucinations", "Nosebleeds", "Severe fatigue", "Slow, sluggish, lethargic feeling", "Weakness "], "Exams and Tests": "A complete blood count (CBC) will show a high number of white blood cells.A blood culture during the first week of the fever can show S. typhi bacteria.Other tests that can help diagnose this condition include:ELISA urine test to look for the bacteria that cause Typhoid fever, Fluorescent antibody study to look for substances that are specific to Typhoid bacteria, Platelet count (platelet count may be low), Stool culture. ", "Treatment": "Fluids and electrolytes may be given by IV (into a vein). Or you may be asked to drink uncontaminated water with electrolyte packets.Antibiotics are given to kill the bacteria. There are increasing rates of antibiotic resistance throughout the world, so your health care provider will check current recommendations before choosing an antibiotic.", "Causes": "S. typhi\u00a0is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria,\u00a0the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. The bacteria travel through the blood to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body.Some persons\u00a0become carriers of S. typhi and continue to release the bacteria in their stools for years, spreading the disease.Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Fewer than 400 cases are reported in the U.S. each year. Most cases in the U.S. are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.", "Prevention": "A vaccine is recommended for travel outside of the U.S. to places where there is typhoid fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has information about where typhoid fever is common. Ask your health care provider if you should bring electrolyte packets in case you get sick.When traveling,\u00a0drink only boiled or bottled water and eat well-cooked food. Water treatment, waste disposal, and protecting the food supply from contamination are important public health measures. Carriers of typhoid must not be allowed to work as food handlers."}, "Tetanus": {"description": "Tetanus is an\u00a0infection of the nervous system with a type of bacteria that is potentially deadly, called Clostridium tetani (C. tetani).", "Possible Complications": "Airway obstruction, Respiratory arrest, Heart failure, Pneumonia, Fractures\r\n  , Brain damage due to lack of oxygen during spasms. ", "Symptoms": ["Drooling", "Excessive sweating", "Fever", "Hand or foot spasms", "Irritability", " \r\n Swallowing difficulty \r\n ", "Uncontrolled urination or defecation "], "Exams and Tests": "Your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. No specific lab test is available to diagnose tetanus.Tests may be used to rule out meningitis, rabies, strychnine poisoning, and other diseases with similar symptoms.", "Treatment": "Treatment may include:Antibiotics, Bedrest with a calm environment (dim light, reduced noise, and stable temperature), Medicine to reverse the poison (tetanus immune globulin), Muscle relaxers, such as diazepam, Sedatives, Surgery to clean the wound and remove the source of the poison (debridement). Breathing support with oxygen, a breathing tube, and a breathing machine may be necessary.", "Causes": "Spores of the bacteria C. tetani are found in the soil, and in animal feces and teeth. In the spore form, C. tetani can remain inactive in the soil. But it can remain infectious for more than 40 years.You can get tetanus infection when the spores enter your body through an injury or wound. The spores release bacteria that spread in the body and make a poison called tetanospasmin (also known as tetanus toxin). This poison blocks nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles, causing severe muscle spasms. The spasms can be so powerful that they tear the muscles or cause fractures of the spine.The time between infection and the first sign of symptoms is about 7 to 21 days. Most cases of tetanus in the United States occur in those who have not been properly vaccinated against the disease.", "Prevention": "IMMUNIZATIONTetanus is completely preventable by being immunized (vaccinated). Immunization usually protects against tetanus infection\u00a0for 10 years.In the United States, immunizations begin in infancy with the DTaP series of shots. The DTaP vaccine is a 3-in-1 vaccine that protects against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus.Td vaccine or Tdap vaccine is used to maintain immunity in those age\u00a07 and older. Tdap vaccine should be given once,\u00a0before age 65, as a substitute for Td for those who have not had Tdap. Td boosters are recommended every 10 years starting at age 19.Older teenagers and adults who get injuries, especially puncture-type wounds, should\u00a0get a tetanus\u00a0booster if it has been\u00a0more than 10 years since the last booster.If you have been injured outside or in any way that makes contact with soil likely, contact your health care provider\u00a0about your risk\u00a0of getting\u00a0tetanus infection. Injuries and wounds should be thoroughly cleaned right away. If the tissue of the wound is dying, a doctor will need to remove the tissue.You may have heard that you can get tetanus if you are injured by a rusty nail. This is true only if the nail is dirty and has the tetanus bacteria on it. It is the dirt on the nail, not the rust, that carries the risk\u00a0of tetanus."}, "Tennis elbow": {"Symptoms": ["Elbow pain that gets worse over time", "Pain\u00a0that radiates\u00a0from the outside of the elbow to the forearm and back of the hand when grasping or twisting", "Weak grasp "], "Exams and Tests": "Your doctor or nurse will examine you.\u00a0\u00a0The exam may show: Pain or tenderness when the tendon is gently pressed near where it attaches to the upper arm bone, over the outside of the elbow, Pain near the elbow when the wrist is bent backwards. X-rays may be done. ", "description": "\r\nTennis elbow is soreness or pain on the outside (lateral) side of the upper arm near the elbow.", "Causes": "The part of the muscle that attaches to a bone is called a tendon. Some of the muscles in your forearm attach to the bone on the outside of your elbow.When you use these muscles over and over again, small tears develop in the tendon. Over time, this leads to irritation and pain where the tendon is attached to the bone.This injury is common in people who play a lot of tennis or other racquet sports, hence the name \"tennis elbow.\" Backhand is the most common stroke to cause symptoms.But\u00a0any activity that involves repetitive twisting of the wrist (like using a screwdriver) can lead to this condition. Painters, plumbers, construction workers, cooks, and butchers are all more likely to develop tennis elbow.This condition may also be due to constant computer keyboard and mouse use.", "Treatment": "The first step is to rest your arm for 2 or 3 weeks and avoid the activity that causes your symptoms. You may also want to:Put ice on the outside of your elbow 2 to 3 times a day., Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),\u00a0such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin.. If your tennis elbow is due to sports activity, you may want to:Ask your health care provider about any changes you can make\u00a0to your technique., Check\u00a0the sports equipment you are using to see if any changes may help. If you play tennis, changing\u00a0the grip size of the racket may help. , Think about how often you play, and whether you should cut back.. If your symptoms are related to working on a computer, ask your manager about changing your workstation or your chair, desk, and computer setup.\u00a0\u00a0A physical therapist can show you exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles of your forearm.You can buy a special brace for tennis elbow at most drugstores. It wraps around the upper part of your forearm and takes some of the pressure off the muscles.Your doctor may also inject cortisone and a numbing medicine around the area where the tendon attaches to the bone. This may help decrease the swelling and pain.If the pain continues after 6 to\u00a012 months of rest and treatment, surgery may be recommended. Talk with your orthopedic surgeon about the risks and whether surgery might help."}}
