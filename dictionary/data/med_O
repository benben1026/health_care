", "description": "Both terms mean that a child\u2019s weight is higher than what is thought to be healthy. ", "Causes": "When children eat more food than their bodies need for normal growth and activity, the extra calories are stored in fat cells for later use. If this pattern continues over time, they develop more fat cells and may develop obesity.Normally, infants and young children respond to signals of hunger and fullness so that they do not consume more calories than their bodies need. However, changes over the last few decades in lifestyle and food choices have led to the rise of obesity among children. Children are surrounded by many things that make it easy to overeat and harder to be active. Foods\u00a0that are\u00a0high in fat and sugar content often come in large portion sizes. These factors can lead children to take in more calories than they need before they feel full. TV commercials and other screen ads can lead to unhealthy food choices. Most of the time, the food in ads aimed at kids is high in sugar, salt, or fats. \"Screen time\" activities such as watching television, gaming, texting, and playing on the computer require very little energy. They often take the place of healthy physical exercise. Also, children tend to crave unhealthy snack foods they see in TV ads. Other factors in the child\u2019s environment can also lead to obesity. Family, friends, and school setting help shape a child\u2019s diet and exercise choices. Food may be used as a reward or to comfort a child. These learned habits can lead to overeating. Many people have a hard time breaking these habits later in life.Genetics, medical conditions, and emotional disorders can also increase a child\u2019s risk for obesity. Hormone disorders or low thyroid function, and certain medications, such as steroids or anti-seizure medications, can increase a child's appetite. Over time, this increases their risk for obesity.An unhealthy focus on eating, weight and body image can lead to an eating disorder. Obesity and eating disorders often occur at the same time in teenage girls and young adult women who may be unhappy with their body image.", "Treatment": "SUPPORTING YOUR CHILDThe first step in helping your child get to a healthy weight is to talk to the child\u2019s doctor. The doctor can help to set healthy goals for weight-loss and help with monitoring and support.Try to get the whole family to join in healthy behavior change. Weight-loss plans for children focus on healthy lifestyle habits. A healthy lifestyle is good for everyone, even if weight loss is not the main goal.Having support from friends and family can also help your child lose weight. CHANGING YOUR CHILD'S LIFESTYLEEating a balanced diet means you child consumes the right types and amounts of foods and drinks to keep their body healthy.Know the right portion sizes for your child\u2019s age so your child gets enough nutrition without overeating., Shop for healthy foods and make them available to your child., Choose a variety of healthy foods from each of the food groups. Eat foods from each group at every meal., Learn more about eating healthy and eating out., Choosing healthy snacks and drinks for your children is important., Fruits and vegetables are good choices for healthy snacks. They are full of vitamins and low in calories and fat. Some crackers and cheeses also make good snacks., Limit junk-food snacks like chips, candy, cake, cookies, and ice cream. The best way to keep kids from eating junk food or other unhealthy snacks is to not have these foods in your house., Avoid sodas, sport drinks, and flavored waters, especially ones made with sugar or corn syrup. These drinks are high in calories and can lead to weight gain. If needed, choose beverages with artificial (man-made) sweeteners. . Make sure children have a chance to engage in healthy physical activity every day.Experts recommend they get 60 minutes of moderate activity every day. Moderate activity means you breathe more deeply than when at rest and your heart beats faster than normal., If your child is not athletic, find ways to motivate your child to be more active., Encourage children to play, run, bike, and play sports during their free time., Children should not watch more than 2 hours of TV a day. . WHAT ELSE TO THINK ABOUTTalk to your health care provider before giving weight loss supplements or herbal remedies to your child. Many claims made by these products are not true.

About half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebra (bone of the spine) during their lifetime.Bone is living tissue. Existing bone is constantly being replaced by new bone. Your entire skeleton is replaced about every 10 years. Osteoporosis occurs when the body fails to form enough new bone, when too much existing bone is reabsorbed by the body, or both.The most important cause of osteoporosis is genetic.

It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns.Younger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons:The tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter., The tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block., Young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses. . The fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear. (\"Glue ear\" is a common name given to OME with thick fluid.) However, fluid thickness is now thought to be\u00a0related to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.

Adults and older children may be given allergy medications. . Most often the fluid will clear on its own. You doctor may suggest watching the condition for a while to see if it is getting worse before recommending treatment.If the fluid is still present after 6 weeks, the doctor may recommend:Continuing to watch the problem, A hearing test, A single trial of antibiotics (if they were not given earlier) . If the fluid is still present at 8 to 12 weeks, antibiotics may be tried. These medicines are not always helpful.At some point, the child's hearing should be tested.If there is significant hearing loss (more than 20 decibels), antibiotics or ear tubes might be needed.If the fluid is still present after 4 to 6 months, tubes are probably needed, even if there is no major hearing loss.Sometimes the adenoids must be taken out for the Eustachian tube to work properly."}, "Otitis": {"description": "Otitis is a general term for infection or inflammation of the ear.", "Causes": "Otitis can affect the inner or outer parts of the ear.

Often it's a last resort if other treatments didn't work and you have severe symptoms. Surgery may be used to:Remove extra tissue at the back of the throat., Correct problems with the structures in the face., Create an opening in the windpipe to bypass the blocked airway if there are physical problems., Remove the tonsils and adenoids. This often cures the condition in children. It does not seem to help most adults.. Surgery may not completely cure obstructive sleep apnea and may have long-term side effects.", "Causes": "When you sleep, all of the muscles in your body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep\u00a0your\u00a0throat open so air can flow into\u00a0your lungs.Normally, your throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some people have a narrow throat. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.Loud snoring is a telltale symptom of sleep apnea. Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.Other factors also may increase your risk:A lower jaw that is short compared to\u00a0your upper jaw\r\n  , Certain shapes of the roof of your mouth (palate) or airway that cause\u00a0it to collapse more easily\r\n  , Large neck or collar size (17 inches or more in men and 16 inches or more in women)\r\n  , Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway\r\n  , Obesity\r\n  , Large tonsils and adenoids in children that can block the airway\r\n  .

Blood tests are not helpful in diagnosing OA.An x-ray will likely show:Loss of the joint space, Wearing down of the ends of the bone, Bone spurs. ", "Causes": "Cartilage is the firm, rubbery tissue that cushions your bones at the joints. It allows bones to glide over one another. When the cartilage breaks down and wears away, the bones rub together. This causes the pain, swelling, and stiffness of OA.As OA worsens, bony spurs or extra bone may form around the joint. The ligaments and muscles around the joint may become weaker and stiffer.\u00a0Before age 55, OA occurs equally in men and women. After age 55, it is more common in women.Other factors can also lead to OA.OA tends to run in families., Being overweight increases the risk of OA in the hip, knee, ankle, and foot joints. This is because extra weight causes more wear and tear., Fractures or other joint injuries can lead to OA later in life. This includes injuries to the cartilage and ligaments in your joints., Jobs that involve kneeling or squatting for more than an hour a day that involve lifting, climbing stairs, or walking increase the risk of OA., Playing sports that involve direct impact on the joint (such as football), twisting (such as basketball or soccer), or throwing also increase the risk of OA.. Medical conditions that can lead to OA include:Bleeding disorders that cause bleeding in the joint, such as hemophilia, Disorders that block the blood supply near a joint and lead to avascular necrosis, Other types of arthritis, such as chronic gout, pseudogout, or rheumatoid arthritis. Watch this video about:Osteoarthritis", "Prevention": "Try not to overuse a painful joint at work or during activities. Maintain a normal body weight. Keep the muscles around your joints strong, especially the weight-bearing joints (knee, hip, ankle).", "Treatment": "OA cannot be cured. It will most likely get worse over time. However, your OA symptoms can be controlled.You can have surgery, but other treatments can improve your pain and make your life much better. Although these treatments cannot make the arthritis go away, they can often delay surgery.MEDICATIONSOver-the-counter pain relievers\u00a0can help with OA symptoms. You can buy these medicines without a prescription.Most doctors recommend acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) first. It has fewer side effects than other drugs. (Do not take more then 3 grams (3,000mg) a day.)If your pain continues, your doctor may recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Types of NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.Supplements that you may use include:Pills\u00a0such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, Capsaicin skin cream to relieve pain. LIFESTYLE CHANGESStaying active and getting exercise can maintain joint and overall movement. Ask your health care provider to recommend an exercise routine. Water exercises, such as swimming, are helpful.Other lifestyle tips include:Applying heat and cold to the joint, Eating healthy foods, Getting enough rest, Losing weight if you are overweight, Protecting your joints from injury. If the pain from OA gets worse, keeping up with activities may become more difficult or painful. Making changes around the home can help take stress off your joints to relieve some of the pain. If your work is causing stress in certain joints, you may need to adjust your work area or change work tasks.PHYSICAL THERAPYPhysical therapy can help improve muscle strength and the motion of stiff joints as well as your balance. If therapy does not make you feel better after 6 to 8 weeks, then it likely will not work at all.Massage therapy may provide short-term pain relief. Make sure you work with a licensed massage therapist who\u00a0is experienced in working on sensitive joints.BRACESSplints and braces\u00a0may help\u00a0support weakened joints. Some types prevent the joint from moving. Others allow some movement. Use a brace only when your doctor or therapist recommends one. Using a brace the wrong way can cause joint damage, stiffness, and pain.ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTSAcupuncture is a traditional Chinese treatment. It is thought that when acupuncture needles stimulate certain points on the body, chemicals that block pain are released.\u00a0 Acupuncture may provide short-term pain relief for OA.S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe, pronounced \"Sammy\") is a manmade form of a natural chemical in the body.\u00a0 It may help reduce joint inflammation and pain.SURGERYSevere cases of OA might need surgery to replace or repair damaged joints. Options include:Arthroscopic surgery to trim torn and damaged cartilage, Changing the alignment of a bone to relieve stress on the bone or joint (osteotomy), Surgical fusion of bones, usually in the spine (arthrodesis), Total or partial replacement of the damaged joint with an artificial joint (knee replacement, hip replacement, shoulder replacement, ankle replacement, elbow replacement).

Because withdrawal reduces\u00a0the person's\u00a0tolerance to the drug, those who have just gone through withdrawal can overdose on a much smaller dose than they used to take.Longer-term treatment is recommended for most persons following withdrawal. This can include self-help groups, like Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery, outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient treatment (day hospitalization), or inpatient treatment.Those withdrawing from opiates should be checked for depression and other mental illnesses. Appropriate treatment of such disorders can reduce the risk of relapse.

The most commonly used medication, clonidine, primarily reduces anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, and cramping.Other medications can treat vomiting and diarrhea.Buprenorphine (Subutex) has been shown to work better than other medications for treating withdrawal from opiates, and it can shorten the length of detoxification (detox). It may also be used for long-term maintenance, like methadone.Persons withdrawing from methadone may be placed on long-term maintenance. This involves slowly decreasing the dosage of methadone over time. This helps reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms.Some drug treatment programs have widely advertised treatments for opiate withdrawal called detox under anesthesia or rapid opiate detox. Such programs involve placing you under anesthesia and injecting large doses of opiate-blocking drugs, with hopes that this will speed up the return the body to normal opioid system function.There is no evidence that these programs actually reduce the time spent in withdrawal. In some cases, they may reduce the intensity of symptoms. However, there have been several deaths associated with the procedures, particularly when it is done outside a hospital.Because opiate withdrawal produces vomiting, and vomiting during anesthesia significantly increases death risk, many specialists think the risks of this procedure significantly outweigh the potential (and unproven) benefits.", "Causes": "About 9% of the population is believed to misuse opiates over the course of their lifetime, including illegal drugs like heroin and prescription pain medications such as Oxycontin.These drugs can cause physical dependence. This means that a person relies on the drug to prevent symptoms of withdrawal. Over time, greater amounts of the drug become necessary to produce the same effect (drug tolerance).The time it takes to become physically dependent varies with each individual.When the person stops taking the\u00a0drugs, the body needs time to recover, and withdrawal symptoms result. Withdrawal from opiates can occur whenever any chronic use is discontinued or reduced.Some people even withdraw from opiates after being given such drugs for pain while in the hospital without realizing what is happening to them.

Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally. The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults. The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat. We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.

You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:Healthy food choices, Healthy snacks, Reading nutrition labels, New ways to prepare food, Portion sizes, Sweetened drinks. Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.Learn ways to manage stress, rather than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your health care provider.

People with hyperparathyroidism are more likely to have osteopenia (thin bones) or osteoporosis (very thin bones) than to have full-blown osteitis fibrosa.", "Treatment": "Most of the bone problems from osteitis fibrosa can be reversed with surgery to remove the abnormal parathyroid gland(s). However, some people may choose to not have surgery, and instead be followed with blood tests and bone measurements. If surgery is not possible, medications can sometimes be used to lower calcium levels.", "Prevention": "Today, routine blood tests done during a medical checkup or for another health problem usually detect high calcium levels before severe damage is done.", "Causes": "The parathyroid glands are four glands in the neck that help control calcium use and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.Too much parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism) can lead to increased bone breakdown, which can cause bones to become weaker and more fragile. Many people with hyperthyroidism develop osteoporosis. Not all bones respond to PTH in the same way. Some develop abnormal areas where the bone is very soft and has almost no calcium in it. This is osteitis fibrosa.Rarely, parathyroid cancer may cause osteitis fibrosa.Before 1950, about half of people diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism had osteitis fibrosa. Now it is uncommon, probably because patients with hyperparathyroidism are diagnosed earlier, before this complication has occurred.People with severe hyperparathyroidism have a higher risk for developing osteitis fibrosa."}, "Oropharynx lesion biopsy": {"description": "An oropharynx lesion biopsy is surgery in which tissue from an abnormal growth or mouth sore is removed and checked for problems."}, "Osmotic diuresis": {"description": "Osmotic diuresis is increased urination due to the presence of certain substances in the fluid filtered by the kidneys.
