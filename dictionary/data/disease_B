If tests confirm you have bladder cancer, additional tests will be done to see if the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Staging helps guide future treatment and follow-up and gives you some idea of what to expect in the future.The TNM (tumor, nodes, metastatis) staging system is used to stage bladder cancer:Ta: The cancer is in the lining of the bladder only and has not spread, T1: The cancer goes through the bladder lining, but does not reach the bladder muscle, T2: The cancer spreads to the bladder muscle, T3: The cancer spreads past the bladder into the fatty tissue surrounding it, T4: The cancer has spread to nearby structures such as the prostate gland, uterus, vagina, rectum, abdominal wall, or pelvic wall . Tumors are also grouped based on how they appear under a microscope. This is called grading the tumor. A high-grade tumor is fast growing and more likely to spread. Bladder cancer can spread into nearby areas, including the:\r\n  Lymph nodes in the pelvis\r\n  , \r\n  Bones\r\n  , \r\n  Liver\r\n  , \r\n  Lungs\r\n  .

Stage II and III treatments:\r\n  Surgery to remove the entire bladder (radical cystectomy) and nearby lymph nodes\r\n  , \r\n  Surgery to remove only part of the bladder, followed by radiation and chemotherapy\r\n  , \r\n  Chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery\r\n  , \r\n  A combination of chemotherapy and radiation (in patients who choose not to have surgery or who cannot have surgery)\r\n  . Most patients with stage IV tumors cannot be cured and surgery is not appropriate. In these patients, chemotherapy is often considered.CHEMOTHERAPYChemotherapy may be given to patients with stage II and III disease either before or after surgery to help prevent the tumor from returning.For early disease (stages 0 and I), chemotherapy is usually given directly into the bladder.A Foley catheter can be used to deliver the medication into the bladder. Common side effects include bladder wall irritation and pain when urinating. For more advanced stages (II-IV), chemotherapy is usually given by vein (intravenously).IMMUNOTHERAPYBladder cancers are often treated with immunotherapy. In this treatment, a medication triggers your immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells. Immunotherapy for bladder cancer is usually performed using the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (commonly known as BCG). A medicine called interferon is sometimes used. It is given through a Foley catheter directly into the bladder. If BCG does not work, patients may receive interferon.As with all treatments, side effects are possible. Ask your doctor what side effects you might expect, and what to do if they occur.SURGERYSurgery for bladder cancer includes:Transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB): Cancerous bladder tissue is removed through the urethra., Partial or complete removal of the bladder: Many people with stage II or III bladder cancer may need to have their bladder removed (radical cystectomy). Sometimes only part of the bladder is removed. Radiation and chemotherapy is usually given after this surgery. . Surgery may also be done to help your body drain urine after the bladder is removed. This may include:Ileal conduit: A small urine reservoir is surgically created from a short piece of your small intestine. The ureters that drain urine from the kidneys are attached to one end of this piece. The other end is brought out through an opening in the skin (a stoma). The stoma allows the patient to drain the collected urine out of the reservoir., Continent urinary reservoir: A pouch to collect urine is created inside your body using a piece of your intestine. You will need to insert a tube into an opening in your skin (stoma) into this pouch to drain the urine., Orthotopic neobladder: This surgery is becoming more common in patients who had their bladder removed. A part of your bowel is folded over to make a pouch that collects urine. It is attached to the place in the body where the urine normally empties from the bladder. This procedure allows you to maintain some normal urinary control. . ", "Causes": "In the United States, bladder cancer usually starts from the cells lining the bladder. These cells are called transitional cells.These tumors are classified by the way they grow:Papillary tumors look like warts and are attached to a stalk., Nonpapillary (sessile) tumors are flat.

But several things may make you more likely to develop it:Cigarette smoking. Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Up to half of all bladder cancers in men and several in women may be caused by cigarette smoke., Chemical exposure at work. About one in four cases of bladder cancer is caused by coming into contact with to cancer-causing chemicals at work. These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk., Chemotherapy: The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may increase the risk of bladder cancer. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to reduce this risk., Radiation treatment: Women who had radiation therapy to treat cervical cancer have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer., Bladder infection: A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer..

Thiamine supplements are given through a shot (injection) or taken by mouth.Other types of vitamins may also be recommended.Blood tests may be done after you are given thiamine supplements to see how well you are responding to the medicine.", "Causes": "There are two major types of beriberi:Wet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system., Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome affect the nervous system.. Beriberi is rare in the United States because most foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in patients who abuse alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store thiamine.A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families). People with genetic beriberi lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time and symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, because\u00a0health care providers\u00a0may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics, this diagnosis is often missed.Beriberi can occur in breastfed infants when the mother's body is lacking in thiamine. The condition can also affect infants who are fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine.Getting dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics raise your risk of beriberi.", "Prevention": "Eating a proper diet that is rich in thiamine and other vitamins will prevent beriberi. Nursing mothers should make sure that their diet contains all vitamins.\u00a0When infants are not\u00a0receiving breast milk, parents need to be\u00a0sure that their baby's infant formula contains thiamine.People who drink heavily should try to cut down or quit. They should take B vitamins to make sure their body is properly absorbing and storing thiamine."}, "Breast cancer": {"description": "In rare cases, breast cancer can start in other areas of the breast.", "Possible Complications": "You may experience side effects or complications from cancer treatment.

Then the doctor will perform a physical exam. The exam includes both breasts, armpits, and the neck and chest area.Tests used to diagnose and monitor patients with breast cancer may include:Breast MRI to help better identify the breast lump or evaluate an abnormal change on a mammogram, Breast ultrasound to show whether the lump is solid or fluid-filled, Breast biopsy, using methods such as needle aspiration, ultrasound-guided, stereotactic, or open. \u00a0CT scan to\u00a0check if the cancer has spread outside the breast\u00a0, Mammography to screen for breast cancer or help identify the breast lump, PET scan to check if the cancer has spread, Sentinel lymph node biopsy to\u00a0check if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes . If your doctor learns that you do have breast cancer, more tests will be done. This is\u00a0called staging, which checks if the cancer has spread. Staging helps guide treatment and follow-up. It also\u00a0gives you\u00a0an idea of what to expect in the future.Breast cancer stages range from 0 to IV. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer.", "Treatment": "Treatment is based on many factors, including:Type and stage of the cancer, Whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones, Whether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses)\u00a0the HER2/neu gene. Cancer treatments may include:Chemotherapy, which uses\u00a0medicines to kill cancer cells., Radiation therapy, which is\u00a0used\u00a0to destroy cancerous tissue., Surgery to\u00a0remove cancerous tissue:\u00a0A lumpectomy removes the breast lump; mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possible nearby structures., Targeted therapy uses\u00a0medicine\u00a0to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth.. Cancer treatment\u00a0can be local or systemic:Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast., Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.. Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (curing). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma\u00a0-- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment., Stage I and II -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery., Stage III -- Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy., Stage IV -- Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.. After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment.Women who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later.", "Causes": "Over the course of a lifetime, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer.Risk factors you cannot change include:Age and gender -- Your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you get older. Most advanced breast cancer cases are found in women over age 50. Men can\u00a0also get breast cancer. But they are 100 times less likely than women to get breast cancer., Family history of breast cancer -- You may also have a higher risk of breast cancer if you have a close relative who has had breast, uterine, ovarian, or colon cancer. , Genes -- The most common gene defects are found in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These genes normally produce proteins that protect you from cancer. If a parent passes you a defective gene, you have an increased risk of breast cancer. Women with one of these defects have up to an 80% chance of getting breast cancer sometime during their life., Menstrual cycle -- Women who got their periods early (before age 12) or went through menopause late (after age 55) have an increased risk of breast cancer.. Other risk factors include:Alcohol use -- Drinking more than 1\u00a0to 2 glasses of alcohol a day may increase your risk of breast cancer., Childbirth -- Women who have never had children or who had\u00a0their first child\u00a0after age 30 have an increased risk of breast cancer. Being pregnant more than once or becoming pregnant at an early age reduces your risk of breast cancer., DES -- Women who took diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage may have an increased risk of breast cancer after age 40. This drug was given to the women in the 1940s\u00a0through the\u00a01960s., Hormone therapy (HT) -- You have a higher risk of breast cancer if you received hormone therapy with estrogen for several years or more., Obesity -- Obesity has been linked to breast cancer, although this link is not\u00a0well understood. Experts think that obese women produce more estrogen. This\u00a0may fuel the development of breast cancer., Radiation -- If you received radiation therapy as a child or young adult to treat cancer of the chest area, you have a very high risk of developing breast cancer. The younger you started such radiation and the higher the dose, the higher your risk. This is especially true if the radiation was given during breast development.. Breast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing underwire bras do not\u00a0increase the risk of breast cancer. There is also no evidence of a direct link between breast cancer and pesticides.", "Prevention": "Talk to your health care provider about how often you should have mammogram. Early breast cancers found by a mammogram have a good chance of being cured.Tamoxifen is approved for breast cancer prevention in women aged 35 and older who are at high risk. Discuss this with your doctor.Women at very high risk\u00a0of breast cancer may consider preventive (prophylactic) mastectomy. This is surgery to\u00a0remove\u00a0the breasts before breast cancer is diagnosed. Possible candidates include: Women who have already had one breast removed due to cancer, Women with a strong family history of breast cancer, Women with genes or genetic mutations that raise their risk of breast cancer (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2). Many risk factors, such as your genes and family history, cannot be controlled.\u00a0But making healthy lifestyle changes may reduce your overall chance of getting cancer.

Antibiotics will be prescribed. Antibiotics that work against a number of different bacteria (broad spectrum antibiotics) are most commonly used. You may be prescribed several different types of antibiotics to make sure treatment works.Antifungal medications may also be prescribed if the infection is likely caused by a fungus.Immediate treatment may be needed if an abscess is injuring brain tissue by pressing on it, or there is a large abscess with a large amount of swelling around that it is raising pressure in the brain.Surgery is needed if :Increased pressure in the brain continues or gets worse, The brain abscess does not get smaller after medication, The brain abscess contains gas (produced by some types of bacteria), The brain abscess might break open (rupture). Surgery consists of opening the skull, exposing the brain, and draining the abscess. Laboratory tests are often done to examine the fluid. This can help identify what is causing the infection, so that more appropriate antibiotics or antifungal drugs can be prescribed.The surgical procedure used depends on the size and depth of the abscess. The entire abscess may be removed (excised) if it is near the surface and enclosed in a sac.Needle aspiration guided by CT or MRI scan may be needed for a deep abscess. During this procedure, medications may be injected directly into the mass.Certain diuretics and steroids may also be used to reduce swelling of the brain.", "Causes": "Brain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. Swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop in response to this infection. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria, and fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass.While this immune response can protect the brain by isolating the infection, it can also do more harm than good. The brain swells. Because the skull cannot expand, the mass may put pressure on delicate brain tissue. Infected material can block the blood vessels of the brain.The germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause. Germs may also travel from a nearby infected area (for example, an ear infection or a tooth abscess) or enter the body during an injury (such as a gun or knife wound) or neurosurgery.In children with congenital\u00a0heart disease or a blood vessel birth defect, such as those with Tetralogy of Fallot, infections are more able to reach the brain from the intestines, teeth, or other body areas.The following raise your risk of a brain abscess:A weakened immune system (such as in AIDS patients), Chronic disease, such as cancer\u00a0 \r\n , Drugs that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy), Right-to-left heart shunts, usually the result of congenital heart disease.

This test screens for esophageal varices and treats them before there is bleeding.", "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to stop acute bleeding as soon as possible. Bleeding must be controlled quickly to prevent shock and death. If massive bleeding occurs, a person may need to be put on a ventilator to protect the airways and prevent blood from going down into the lungs.To treat acute bleeding: The health care provider may inject the varices directly with a clotting medicine, or place a rubber band around the bleeding veins. This procedure is done using a small lighted tube called an endoscope. , A medication that tightens blood vessels (vasoconstriction) may be used. Examples include octreotide or vasopressin., Rarely, a tube may be inserted through the nose into the stomach and inflated with air. This produces pressure against the bleeding veins (balloon tamponade).. Once the bleeding is stopped, varices can be treated with medicines and medical procedures to prevent future bleeding including:Drugs called beta blockers, such as propranolol and nadolol that reduce the risk of bleeding., A rubber band can be placed around the bleeding veins during an EGD procedure., Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This is a procedure to create new connections between two blood vessels in your liver. This can decrease pressure in the veins and prevent bleeding episodes from happening again. . Emergency surgery may be used (rarely) to treat patients if other therapy fails. Portocaval shunts or surgery to remove the esophagus are two treatment options, but these procedures are risky.Patients with bleeding varices from liver disease may need more treatment for their liver disease, including a liver transplant.", "Causes": "Scarring (cirrhosis) of the liver is the most common cause of esophageal varices. This scarring cuts down on blood flowing through the liver. As a result, more blood flows through the veins of the esophagus.The extra blood flow causes the veins in the esophagus to balloon outward. Heavy bleeding can occur if the veins break open.Any type of chronic liver disease can cause esophageal varices.Varices can also occur in the upper part of the stomach.", "Prevention": "Treating the causes of liver disease may prevent bleeding. Preventive treatment of varices with drugs such as beta blockers or with endoscopic banding may help prevent bleeding.

Look for small, painful nodules called trigger points that can cause pain throughout the head and face, Relax your face and jaw muscles throughout the day. The goal is to make facial relaxation a habit., Try to reduce your daily stress and learn relaxation techniques.. To prevent damage to the teeth, mouth guards or appliances (splints) are often used to treat teeth grinding, clenching, and TMJ disorders. A splint may help protect the teeth from the pressure of clenching.A well-fitting splint should help reduce clenching. However, some people find that the symptoms go away as long as they use the splint, but pain returns when they stop. The splint may also not work as well over time.There are many types of splints. Some fit over the top teeth, some on the bottom. They may be designed to keep your jaw in a more relaxed position or provide some other function. If one type doesn't work, another may.A splint called the NTI-tss fits over just the front teeth. The idea is to keep all of your back teeth (molars) completely separated, under the theory that most clenching is done on these back teeth. With the NTI, the only contact is between the splint and a bottom front tooth.After splint therapy, orthodontic adjustment of the bite pattern may help some people. Surgery should be considered a last resort.Finally, there have been many approaches to try to help people unlearn their clenching behaviors. These are more successful for daytime clenching. In some people, just relaxing and modifying daytime behavior is enough to reduce nighttime bruxism. Methods to directly modify nighttime clenching have not been well studied. They include biofeedback devices, self-hypnosis, and other alternative therapies.", "Causes": "People can clench and grind without being aware of it. It can happen during both the day and night, although sleep-related bruxism is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control.There is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench their teeth and never feel symptoms. Factors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person.

Tests that may be done include:Alkaline phosphatase blood level, Bone biopsy, Bone scan, Chest x-ray, CT scan of the chest, MRI of the bone and surrounding tissue, X-ray of bone and surrounding tissue . This disease may also affect the results of the following tests:Alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme, Blood calcium level, Parathyroid hormone, Blood phosphorus level . ", "Treatment": "Some benign bone tumors go away on their own and do not need treatment. Your doctor will closely monitor you. You will likely need regular imaging tests, such as x-rays, to see if the tumor shrinks or grows. Surgery may be needed to remove the tumor in some cases.Treatment for cancerous bone tumors that have spread from other parts of the body depends on where the cancer started. Radiation therapy may be given to prevent fractures or to relieve pain.Tumors that start in the bone are rare. After biopsy, a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is usually necessary. Radiation therapy may be needed before or after surgery.", "Causes": "The cause of bone tumors is unknown. They often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly. Possible causes include:Genetic defects passed down through families, Radiation, Injury . In most cases, no specific cause is found.Osteochondromas are the most common noncancerous (benign) bone tumors, and occur most often in people between the ages of 10 and 20.Cancers that start in the bones are referred to as primary bone tumors. Cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or colon) are called secondary or metastatic bone tumors. They behave very differently from primary bone tumors. Multiple myeloma often affects or involves the bone, but is not considered a primary bone tumor.Cancerous (malignant) bone tumors include:Chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, Fibrosarcoma, Osteosarcomas. The cancers that most often spread to the bone are cancers of the:Breast, Kidney, Lung, Prostate, Thyroid . These forms of cancer usually affect older people.Bone cancer is more common in persons who have a family history of cancers."}, "Biliary stricture": {"description": "A biliary stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the common bile duct, the tube that moves bile from the liver to the small intestine. Bile is a substance that helps with digestion.", "Possible Complications": "Inflammation and narrowing of the biliary duct may return in some people. There is a risk for infection above the narrowed area. Strictures that remain for a long period can lead to liver damage (cirrhosis).", "Symptoms": ["Abdominal pain\r\n  on the upper right side of belly", "Chills", "Fever", "Itching", "Jaundice", "Nausea and vomiting", "Pale or clay-colored stools"], "Exams and Tests": "The following tests can help diagnose this condition:Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC), Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The following blood tests can help reveal a problem with the biliary system.Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is higher than normal., Bilirubin level is higher than normal.. This condition may also alter the results of the following tests:Amylase level, Lipase level, Urine bilirubin, Prothrombin time (PT). ", "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to correct the narrowing so bile can flow from the liver into the intestine.This may involve:Surgery, Endoscopic or percutaneous dilation . If surgery is done, the stricture is removed. The common bile duct will be rejoined with the small intestine.In some cases, a tiny metal or plastic mesh tube (stent) is placed across the bile duct stricture to keep it open. ", "Causes": "A biliary stricture is often caused by injury to the bile ducts during surgery. For example, it may occur after surgery to remove the gallbladder.Other causes of this condition include:Cancer of the bile duct, Damage and scarring due to a gallstone in the bile duct, Pancreatitis, Primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Your doctor may\u00a0recommend the following antifungal medicines when the disease is severe or spreads outside of the lungs.Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Ketoconazole . Amphotericin B may be used for severe infections.Follow up regularly with your doctor to make sure the infection does not return.", "Causes": "You can get blastomyocosis by contact with moist soil, most commonly where there is rotting wood and leaves. The fungus enters the body through the lungs, where the infection starts. The fungus then spreads to other parts of the body. The disease may affect the skin, bones and joints, and other areas.Blastomycosis is rare. It is found in the central and southeastern United States, and in Canada, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Africa.The key risk factor for the disease is contact with infected soil. It most often affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or who have had an organ transplant. Men are more likely to be affected than women.", "Prevention": "Avoiding travel to areas where the infection is known to occur may help prevent exposure to the fungus, but this may not always be possible.

Possible tests include:Abdominal CT scan, Abdominal x-ray, Blood tests to check nutritional status, Upper GI series with small bowel follow through contrast x-ray . ", "Treatment": "Treatment most often starts with antibiotics for the excess bacteria growth, along with vitamin B12 supplements. If antibiotics are not effective, surgery may be needed to help food flow through the intestines. ", "Causes": "The name of this condition refers to the \"blind loop\" formed by part of the intestine that is bypassed. This blockage does not allow digested food to flow normally through the intestinal tract.The substances needed to digest fats (called bile salts) do not work as they should when a section of the intestine is affected by blind loop syndrome. This prevents fat and fat-soluble vitamins from being absorbed into the body. It also leads to fatty stools. Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur because the extra bacteria that form in the blind loop use up this vitamin. Blind loop syndrome is a complication that occurs:After many operations, including subtotal gastrectomy (surgical removal of part of the stomach) and operations for extreme obesity, As a complication of inflammatory bowel disease. Diseases such as diabetes or scleroderma may slow down movement in a segment of the intestine, leading to blind loop syndrome."}, "Bartholin cyst or abscess": {"Symptoms": ["A tender lump on either side of the vaginal opening \r\n", "Fever", "Pain with sexual intercourse "], "Exams and Tests": "The health care provider will do a pelvic exam.

These glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening.", "Causes": "A Bartholin abscess forms when a small opening (duct) from the gland gets blocked. Fluid in the gland builds up and may become infected. Fluid may build up over many years before an abscess occurs.Often the abscess appears quickly over several days. The area will become very hot and swollen. Activity that puts pressure on the vulva, and walking and sitting, may cause severe pain.", "Treatment": "SELF-CARE STEPSSoaking in warm water four times a day for several days can ease the discomfort. It can also help the abscess open and drain on its own. However, the opening is often very small and closes quickly. Therefore, the abscess often returns.DRAINAGE OF THE ABSCESSA small surgical cut can completely drain the abscess. This relieves symptoms and provides the fastest recovery. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia in a doctor's office., A catheter (tube) may be inserted and left in place for 4 - 6 weeks to continue to allow draining while the area heals., You should begin soaking in warm water 1 - 2 days afterward. You cannot have sexual intercourse until the catheter is removed. . Antibiotics may be prescribed if there is pus or other signs of infection.MARSUPIALIZATIONWomen can also be treated with a minor surgical procedure called marsupialization. The procedure involves creating a small, permanent opening to help the gland drain., The procedure can sometimes be done in the clinic with medicine to numb the area. In other cases it may need to be done in the hospital with general anesthesia so that you are asleep and pain-free., You should begin soaking in warm water 1 - 2 days afterward. You cannot have sexual intercourse for 4 weeks after surgery., You can use oral pain medicines after the procedure. Your doctor may prescribe narcotic pain medicines if you need them. .

Some people may have to change jobs to avoid further exposure.Medications used for asthma, such as bronchodilators, will usually improve symptoms. Corticosteroids may be prescribed in more severe cases.Stopping smoking is very important for people with this condition. Breathing treatments, including nebulizers, may be prescribed if the condition becomes long-term. Home oxygen therapy may be needed if blood oxygen level is\u00a0low.Physical exercise programs, breathing exercises, and patient education programs are often helpful for people with a chronic lung disease.", "Causes": "Breathing in (inhaling) the dust produced by raw cotton can cause byssinosis. It is most common in people who work in the textile industry.Those who are sensitive to the dust can have an asthma-like condition after being exposed.Methods of prevention in the U.S. have reduced the number of cases. Byssinosis is still common in developing countries. Smoking increases the risk\u00a0of this disease. Being exposed to the dust many times can lead to chronic lung disease and shortness of breath or wheezing.", "Prevention": "Controlling dust, using face masks, and other measures can reduce the risk.
