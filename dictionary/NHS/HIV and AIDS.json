{  "Introduction":{  "Description": "HIV is a virus which attacks the immune system, and weakens your ability to fight infections and disease  It's most commonly caught by having sex without a condom It can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment, and from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus  The virus attacks the immune system, and weakens your ability to fight infections and disease There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments to enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections  With early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV will not go on to develop AIDS ",  "How do you get HIV?": "HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, which includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood, and breast milk  It is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long   HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat or urine The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is by anal or vaginal sex without a condom  According to statistics from Public Health England, 95% of those diagnosed with HIV in the UK in 2013 acquired HIV as a result of sexual contact Other ways of getting HIV include: using a contaminated needle, syringe or other injecting equipment tranmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding through oral sex or sharing sex toys (although the risk is significantly lower than for anal and vaginal sex)  Read more about what causes HIV ",  "Getting tested": "The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test If you think you have put yourself at risk of HIV, you should seek medical advice and have a test as soon as recommended  The earlier HIV is diagnosed, the earlier you can start treatment and avoid becoming ill Emergency anti-HIV medication called PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) may stop you becoming infected, but treatment must be started within three days of coming into contact with the virus There are a number of places you can get an HIV test, including your GP surgery and sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust Most HIV tests in the UK involve taking a small sample of blood and sending this to a laboratory for analysis  These tests can provide a reliable result from four weeks after possible infection and results are usually available within a few days  It is also possible to test using a saliva sample or pin-prick (blood-spot) test, and many sexual health clinics now use these tests routinely as the result is available within a few minutes and do not need to be sent to the lab  However, these tests do not reliably detect HIV if you have been infected within the past few weeks You may get the results in hours, days or weeks, depending on the type of test you take If your test is positive, you will be referred to a specialist HIV clinic where you'll have more blood tests to show what effect HIV is having on your immune system and be able to discuss treatment options Find out more about coping with a positive HIV test Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection  However, the two groups with highest rates of HIV in the UK are gay and bisexual men and African men and women NICE recommends that annual HIV tests be offered to all men who have sex with men, and more frequent testing be offered to those at higher risk due to multiple partners or unsafe sexual practices ",  "Screening for HIV in pregnancy": "All pregnant woman are offered a blood test to check if they have HIV as part of routine antenatal screening  If untreated, HIV can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding  Treatment in pregnancy greatly reduces the risk of passing on HIV to the baby Read more about screening for HIV during pregnancy ",  "Living with HIV":"Although there is no cure for HIV, treatments are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage  These medicines come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but taking a combination of different drugs makes this much less likely  Most people with HIV take a combination of three antiretrovirals and it is vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor You will be encouraged to take regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, stop smoking and have yearly flu jabs and five-yearly pneumococcal vaccinations to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur  This is known as late-stage HIV infection or AIDS Read more about living with HIV ",  "Preventing HIV":"Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection The best way to prevent HIV is to use a condom for sex and to never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs)  Knowing your HIV status and that of your partner is also important ",  "How common is HIV?": "At the end of 2013, there were an estimated 107,800 people in the UK living with HIV  The majority were infected through sex (43,500 gay and bisexual men and 59,500 heterosexuals) A quarter of people with HIV (over 26,100) do not know they are infected Around one in every 360 people in the UK has HIV, but the two groups with highest rates of HIV are gay and bisexual men and Black African heterosexuals, where the rates are approximately one in 17 and one in 18 respectively The World Health Organization estimates that around 35 million people in the world are living with HIV The virus is more common in sub-Saharan African countries, such as South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique Find out more about: the symptoms of HIV what causes HIV treating HIV visiting an STI clinic"  },  "SYmptoms":["fever (raised temperature)", "sore throat", "body rash", "tiredness", "joint pain", "muscle pain", "swollen glands (nodes)", "weight loss", "chronic diarrhoea", "night sweats", "skin problems", "recurrent infections", "serious life-threatening illnesses"],  "Causes": {  "Description": "In the UK, most cases of HIV are caused by having sex without a condom with a person who has HIV A person with HIV can pass the virus to others whether or not they have any symptoms  People with HIV are more infectious in the weeks following infection HIV treatment significantly reduces the risk of someone with HIV passing it on ",  "Sexual contact": "According to Public Health England, 95% of people diagnosed with HIV in the UK in 2011 acquired HIV through sexual contact The main routes of transmission are unprotected vaginal and anal sex  It is also possible to catch HIV through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is much lower The risk of HIV transmission through oral sex will be higher if the person giving oral sex has mouth ulcers, sores or bleeding gums and/or if the person receiving oral sex has been recently infected with HIV (and has a lot of the virus in their body) or another sexually transmitted infection The type of sex also makes a difference to the level of risk: performing oral sex on a man with HIV carries some risk, particularly if he ejaculates (comes) in your mouth it is possible to catch HIV by performing oral sex on a woman with HIV, particularly if she is having a period, although this is considered to be extremely low risk receiving oral sex from someone who has HIV is also extremely low risk as HIV is not transmitted through saliva",  "Other risk behaviours": "Other ways of getting HIV include: sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment  from mother to baby before or during birth or by breastfeeding sharing sex toys with someone infected with HIV healthcare workers accidentally pricking themselves with an infected needle (this risk is extremely low) blood transfusion (now very rare in the UK, but still a problem in developing countries)",  "How is HIV transmitted": "HIV is not passed on easily from one person to another  The virus does not spread through the air like cold and flu viruses HIV lives in the blood and in some body fluids  To get HIV, one of these fluids from someone with HIV has to get into your blood The body fluids that contain enough HIV to infect someone are: semen vaginal fluids, including menstrual blood breast milk blood lining inside the anus Other body fluids, like saliva, sweat or urine, do not contain enough of the virus to infect another person The main ways the virus enters the bloodstream are:  by injecting into the bloodstream (with a contaminated needle or injecting equipment) through the thin lining on or inside the anus and genitals through the thin lining of the mouth and eyes via cuts and sores in the skin HIV is not passed on through: kissing spitting being bitten contact with unbroken, healthy skin being sneezed on sharing baths, towels or cutlery using the same toilets or swimming pools mouth-to-mouth resuscitation contact with animals or insects such as mosquitoes",  "How HIV infects the body": "HIV infects cells of the immune system, the bodyâ€™s defence system, causing progressive damage and eventually making it unable to fight off infections The virus enters cells in the immune system called CD4 cells + ve lymphocyte cells, which protect the body against various bacteria, viruses and other germs It uses the CD4 cells to make thousands of copies of itself  These copies then leave the CD4 cells, killing them in the process This process continues until eventually the number of CD4 cells, also called your CD4 count, drops so low that your immune system stops working This can take about 10 years, during which time you will feel and appear well  Find out more about the symptoms of HIV ",  "Who is most at risk?": "People who are at higher risk of becoming infected with HIV include: men who have had unprotected sex with men women who have had sex without a condom with men who have sex with men people who have had sex without a condom with a person who has lived or travelled in Africa people who inject drugs people who have had sex without a condom with somebody who has injected drugs people who have caught another sexually transmitted infection people who have received a blood transfusion while in Africa, eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, Asia or central and southern America"  } }
